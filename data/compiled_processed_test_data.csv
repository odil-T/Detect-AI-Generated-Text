350,0,"""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously"". Car reduction helps the environment more than what people think it would. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United states greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in America behavior:recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". Not having a car is better for you and the environment because not only would you be exercising by walking but there will be less pollution in the economy. Cars waste to much gas and have a lot of unnecessary waste in them that could end up to be one day global warming and kill of all the good air we breath in now. People should look in to not having a car and start walking, biking, skating and do more than what they use to do when they had a car.

Paris, Germany, United States, New York, Colombia and many other places are starting be more car free because they heard what cars can do to the environment. According the text "" in Colombia has a program that they started that spreads to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day the other day, leaving the streets of the capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"". The more and more people hear about this program the more people will get into the habit of not having a car or not using a car to go everywhere they have to go to. ""If the patterns persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"".

Most people who are involved in the program see a huge difference in their community like the streets are cleaner, there are no traffic jams, the streets are safer, and there's less pollution in the air. As we all know that cars are sometimes important to us to get to where we need to get but is it really that important to us to have a car not really because if we would stop being lazy and just get up from our couches and walk, bike, or skate to where we needed to go we'll see that having a car is not as important as we used to think. In Colombia two other citizens joined the event and found that ""these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing broders"". So really one program can change the whole world if people just joined and saw for them selves what a huge impact it can be on others.

More parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city and there are more smooth sidewalks and restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift"". New York also started there own program which is this bikingsharing program and it's skyrocketed bridge and the tunnel tools reflect those new priorities, and of course a proiferation of carsharing program across the nation. In some cities you have to take a car like in San Francisco because everything is so far away and you can not walk to where you need to go it will take forever to get there walking which is understandable. But in other cities or places were everything is close to you then there's no point of taking a car instead of walking to the place you need to go to. Cars waste a lot of gas which means that gas prices go up way to much because of the usahe of cars instead of biking, skating, or walking. You get more done when your walking, biking, or skating because you are less worried about running out of gas or having to push the car to the nearest gas station.",0,"in the United States the Environmental Protection Agency be promote car reduce community and legislator be start to act if cautiously car reduction help the environment more than what people think it would President Obama 's ambitious goal to curb the United state greenhouse gas emission unveil last week will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in America behavior recent study suggest that Americans be buy few car drive less and get few license as each year go by not have a car be well for you and the environment because not only would you be exercise by walk but there will be less pollution in the economy car waste to much gas and have a lot of unnecessary waste in they that could end up to be one day global warming and kill of all the good air we breath in now People should look in to not have a car and start walk biking skating and do more than what they use to do when they have a car

849,0,"There are so many advantages of limiting car usage. In source one, the vaughn's streets are completely ""carfree"". This is for the good of not cluttering the streets with so many cars but actually making more space and less cars on the streets. In source one, it says ""while there hace been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs."" That right there says they have been trying to reduce car usage for a while now and convince citizens that transportation can be better to use. Instead of having over a million cars on the streets or high ways or anywhere, many people can come together and take transportation train or bus to where ever they need to go. It also makes time for walking, which is a very good exercise. Many people have become lazy and take their car to drive to the store thats right there on the corner instead of walking. Many people have taken car usage over the limits and don't realize how it is polluting our air.

Pollution is a big problem in our ecosystem now and days. Many people don't clearly see this and don't take the time to process in how bad its making earth. Pollution has gone up over the years and decades after decades we have tried to stop it. In source two, it says ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" Why? Well because of the exaggerated use of cars. They have tried to reduce the usage in order to make their air cleaner and better. They have gotten the idea of limiting car usage by ordering people with evennumbered license plates to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine on Mondays. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day. With this new policy, it has shown better air in the city of Paris by Monday. I believe this is a great forced rule. We need to change our ways and work better in making our air cleaner.

Traffic jams is another downfall of using cars. With so many cars out in the streets it causes the air to have so much smog. Many people have participated in bike riding and walking, but not only is it exercise for your health but it keeps away from people using their cars. With so many people participating this action, not only has it made better air burt also constructed and cropped up new restaurants and shopping districts. They cleared the side walk to make it smoother and cut traffic, as said in source three. This is all in Bogota, Columbia. They said it has made a drastic change in their community with better air and I believe it has made their air better and way reduced smog.

In the United States, President Obama's goal was to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. This has led to many people participating in this action. A very big amount of Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and fewer licences as each year goes by as said in source four. To keep this at a going rate each year I believe citizens should work harder to improve more in this situation as in car pooling, bicycle and public transportation.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages in reducing car usage. Better air, better community and healthier citizens.",0,"there be so many advantage of limit car usage in source one the vaughn 's street be completely carfree this be for the good of not clutter the street with so many car but actually make more space and less car on the street in source one it say while there hace be effort in the past two decade to make city dense and well for walk planner be now take the concept to the suburb that right there say they have be try to reduce car usage for a while now and convince citizen that transportation can be well to use instead of have over a million car on the street or high way or anywhere many people can come together and take transportation train or bus to where ever they need to go it also make time for walking which be a very good exercise many people have become lazy and take their car to drive to the store that s right there on the corner instead of walk many people have take car usage over the limit and do n't realize how it be pollute our air

150,1,"Dear Senator, Good day, I am writing this letter to let you know it's time for things to change. I have been reading and researching the Electoral College and i have a strong opinion on it. As you know, the Electoral College is a process when all five hundred and thirty eight electors vote on electors and defenders. This way of voting for electors lets the people have no say in whose running our government! Our government should not allow or be based on ""the winner takes all"" method. When we choose for OUR president we should be able to choose OUR electors too! Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. The electors shouldnt be chosen by the candidate's political party, we should choose. By voting for a president every four years a new party of electors have already been selected to run with him and we dont get any say. After the presidential election, your governor creates a list of all the candidates that ran for president in your state with a list of their representative electors. This is later sent to Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all agree that we need to remove and forget about the electoral college. This year our voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. Still the electoral college still has defenders fror themselves is crazy. Facts say voters arent actually voting for the president, but for a group of electors who in turn elect the president, and that is ridiculous. How are we supposed to trust these electors if we dont even know who they are and their background until after the election? Who even are these electors i wondered. I figured out that all the electors are actually anyone with a brain and not holding a public office, fantastic. So how do i know they are reliable and going to do whats best for my state and our country? Voters dont even control whom their electors vote for most of the time which is kind of scary. Some electors are even faithless in their party's candidate so they dont even vote for them at all! How can we rely on a group of people who dont rely on their party?

As much as I hate to say it, there most definitley is an upside to the Electoral College. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in. Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Sometimes the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Another reason The Electoral College is a positive way of voting is how certain the outcome is. There is never failure in the counting of the votes and there us rarely a tie between two people. My favorite reason is because ""everybody is president"". This means everybody can make their own decisions and have a great amount of freedom.

Even though im all for removing the Electoral College there is positives too. In a few years when i am able to vote, i will be careful of who I vote for and make sure that there is great electors in the party i vote for.",0,"dear Senator good day I be write this letter to let you know it be time for thing to change I have be read and research the Electoral College and I have a strong opinion on it as you know the Electoral College be a process when all five hundred and thirty eight elector vote on elector and defender this way of voting for elector let the people have no say in whose run our government our government should not allow or be base on the winner take all method when we choose for OUR president we should be able to choose our elector too under the 23rd amendment of the constitution the District of Columbia be allocate 3 elector and treat like a state for purpose of the electoral college the elector should nt be choose by the candidate 's political party we should choose by vote for a president every four year a new party of elector have already be select to run with he and we do nt get any say after the presidential election your governor create a list of all the candidate that run for president in your state with a list of their representative elector this be later send to Congress and the National Archives as part of the official record of the presidential election

1023,1,"Many people are not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. Many prefer changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United States since the Electoral College is unfair. It is. The electoral college is unfair in many ways and we should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

One reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote instead of the Electoral College is because the states aren't all equal and electoral college isn't fair. In the Electoral College, California has more of a say than Georgia. California has 55 electoral college, while Georgia has 16. How is that fair? ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"" Plumer 13. This line tells us that candidates stay out of states that they know they won't win. Say there was a candidate campaigning, they will most likely focus on the states that have the most electoral college, like California or Texas. They won't go to states that only have three votes. That's not fair to the states that have a small population. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" Posner 6. If electoral votes wasn't a thing, Gore would be president. He's the candidate that won most popular votes, meaning that he got the most votes in the nation. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" Plumer 10. Not always? What's the point of voting if the vote won't even count?

Another reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote is because the popular vote will be more precise and it's much easier. There could be less ties, and the candidate that everyone really wants as president will become the president. ""Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" Posner 16. Gore was the candidate that everyone wanted as president. It just doesn't seem fair that the candidate that won popular vote, isn't or wasn't the president.

Overall, the people should change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States instead of using a system that is unfair to the states and the people.",0,"many people be not in favor of keep the Electoral College many prefer change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States since the Electoral College be unfair it be the electoral college be unfair in many way and we should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States

1100,0,"Not a day goes by that you don't see a car passing by on the street. Often, we don't think much of it and the effects it has. Throughout the world there are communities campaigning, trying to lower the usage of motor vehicles. The citizens in these communities are aware of all the cons that come with driving cars. There are plenty of benefits to not driving cars everyday such as, lower the amount of air pollution, being inclined and motivated to exercise often, and the money that this act can save.

The number of cars being purchased in America has been dwindling with each year that passes. If this pattern persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This is due to the fact that transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just barely behind the power plants. At one point in Paris, France, there was an extreme case of congestion which provided the air with more than its fare share of smog. The city was told to momentarily stop the driving of motor vehicles. congestion went down 60 percent after five days of intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the world's most polluted cities. By driving a car less the environment benefits emmecely.

In Vauban, Germany it costs 40,000 to have a place to park your car along with your home. As a result from that about 70% of the families in Vauban don't even own a car, let alone drive one. Heidrum Walter notified people saying, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" She along with &0% of the citizens walk verdant streets and ride bicycles. As a result they are getting a measure of exercise more than they would be getting if the drove cars. When you excersise and sweat, your body releases endorphines which triggers a chemical in your body. The triggering of that chemical causes you to feel happier which is just what the people of Vauban are.

Some people are very well capable of purchasing a car but don't. Just that simple Non act saves them quite a handful of money. Now, sometimes things like driving a car are necessary, so I'm not saying NEVER drive your car. However, if in the cases where it isn't necessary you were to walk or ride a bike you would potentially be saving pockets of money because gas isn't being purchased as frequwntly as it would be otherwise. The reduced amount of car driving even benefits your bank account.

Motor vehicles, such as cars and motorcycles, are not always necessary. Not utilizing them comes with plenty of benefits. It reduces the amount of smog and air pollution, it makes you healthier and potentially happier, and lastly it saves you money. Walk around a little. Go on a bike ride.

5,1,"The electrol college system is an unfair system, people don't have the right to select their own president, they dont have the right to select a president. Because, when people vote they are technically voting for the electors for a candied. That candidate can be a democratic or a republican. In source two it states that electors can choose there opposing candidate. Which declines the the whole voting process. Why do we vote? we vote to select a leader who will defend this country and make america a place of opportunity. The most important reason why the electrol cllege is unfair because of the "" winners it take all"" rule.

We as american people cannot choose their own government, as it says in source two, that when voters vote they are voting for the candidates electors. Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amount of electoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college, then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair because if the majority of a state for example chose republican candidate, then that would be vague because some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral college, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.

In source two it says that electoral who have been select by the state can choose their opposing candidtade, which is more disatvantgeing to the american people and america's future. for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were ""faithless"" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america.

In source two and three it states the rule "" winner take it all"". The votes the other lose the, winning can take it all, that vote that they take from the losing does not count Because the people really didnt mean to vote for the candidate they don't want or the candidate they dont support, its like your money fell on the floor and someone just took it knowing its yours.

In conclusion, the state senators should eliminate the electoral college because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.",0,"the electrol college system be an unfair system people do n't have the right to select their own president they do nt have the right to select a president because when people vote they be technically vote for the elector for a candied that candidate can be a democratic or a republican in source two it state that elector can choose there oppose candidate which decline the the whole voting process why do we vote we vote to select a leader who will defend this country and make america a place of opportunity the most important reason why the electrol cllege be unfair because of the winner it take all rule

1270,0,"From the small town of Cocoa, Florida, to the busy streets of Beijing, China, driving cars is a global phenomenon. It could be said that reducing the use of cars is beneficiary to the human population. Although, some believe that the negative effects of limiting automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcomes. The superior argument, however, is overall, less vehicle use.

Limiting car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale. According to source 1, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This shows that the the excessive use of transportation harms the ozone layer. Even at 12 percent, the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth's atmosphere. According to source 4, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants. If the numbers were reduced, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run. The world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental patterns.

Furthermore, there is more justification for the advantages of limiting car usage. According the source 2, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. This was due to the fact that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air five days before. The amount of time it took to air out smog that rivaled Beijing,China is an impressive factor of being fuel efficient. According the source 3, Bogota Columbia has a program where, for a day, you go around town carfree. It is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. This has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Not only does the environment become more habitable, but your physical health is improved as well.

However, some would argue that limiting vehicle use is not the route to go. According to source 2, when the Paris driving ban was enforced, delivery companies complained of lost profit. This is not completely true since plugin cars, hybrids, and other earthfriendly cars were unaffected by the Parisian ban. Car companies will still be in business because of the use of green cars instead of fossil fuelpowered automobiles. According to source 4, demographic research has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. This may harm the next generation as they become more dependent on alternative methods of traveling. It does not mean, however, that they won't have similar efficiency of speed and reliability with different transportations as they would now. The goverenment will have more money from public transportation to improve upon the community, and greener way. of traveling, like walking or bike riding, will create stronger immune systems and keep the majority of the population in healthy physical shape. The argument of the disadvantages of limiting car usage is somewhat counterproductive, as shown in this paragraph.

Cars, one of the less significant necessities of a well functioning society, will continue to be used. Children, teens, and adults alike will all be affected by the results of driving. We do require a method of convienient transportation for daily occurences, however, there is an extent over how much driving is sufficient to continue our everyday lives. Whatever an individual's decision may be, the amount of car usage will determine the living conditions on Earth for generations to come.",0,"from the small town of Cocoa Florida to the busy street of Beijing China drive car be a global phenomenon it could be say that reduce the use of car be beneficiary to the human population although some believe that the negative effect of limit automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcome the superior argument however be overall less vehicle use 

 limit car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale accord to source 1 passenger car be responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe this show that the the excessive use of transportation harm the ozone layer even at 12 percent the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth 's atmosphere accord to source 4 transportation be the second large source of America 's emission just behind powerplant if the number be reduce it will have beneficial implication for carbon emission and the environment this would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run the world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental pattern

58,0,"Why are the streets always so jammed!? Everyone asks that all the time almost everyday around 5:00pm. The reason for is because cars being excessively used nowadays. There are several different advantages that can happen when limiting car usage. The world would be a better place if less cars were used on the roads.

To begin with, why do we the people use cars? The reason is because it can get us from A to B really fast. But that's only 1 positive for the usage of cars. Think about the negatives and disadvantages of using cars. My 1 main reason of the usage of cars is that it make the world less active. Walking or running is a daily form of exercise, and the usage of cars is limiting the numbers of that. In section 1 redrum Walter says that he always was tense when he had a car, he's much happier without one. This is why we should limit the usage of cars. We don't want the people to be tense all the time, we want them to enjoy and relax when using transportation other than cars. Walking will take longer but is better in the long run. You don't have traffic jams, you can go places and areas that cars couldn't fit through and you have many different ways of getting to a particular place rather than just a road. The only repercussion that you have to worry about with walking is the rain. But heres the thing, In section 3 Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" This means rain isn't a problem when walking on the streets. Cars may offer more protection but its more dangerous than walking. This is why places like Germany, Paris, and Bogota are trying to carry out the experience of a ""carfree"" life.

In addition, another advantage of limiting car use is limiting riots. I know we have all heard of people screaming and arguing in the cars of people in front or behind them. This is a big problem nowadays and it's because of the use of cars. If we can limit the usage of cars than we can hopefully reduce the level of aggrevation on the streets. Alot of accidents happen everyday dealing with the usage of cars. Cars provoke alot of deaths if you think about it. If we could limit the usage of driving cars than this will limit the amount of deaths per year by cars. That's the number 1 disadvantages to the using of cars. Walking and biking are my 2 favorite types of transportation because it's smooth, and it's more conveinant. Less accidents and injurys happen when walking or riding a bike. This can also help the streets be less packed which will allow for easier access to certain places. DUI is the main worst tragic that comes from the usage of cars. Many people die everyday because of drunk drivers and thats not respectable. Just imagine if the same person who caused an accident in the car while drunk was drunk on the streets while walking, he more than likely couldn't of caused an accident if he was walking and not driving a car. Just think about all of the disadvantages that cars promote.

Last but not least, comes the president Barack Obamas most valuable reason to limit car usage. Obama wants to curb the U.S greenhouse gas emissions, and by that he wants to get fewer cars on the road. In section 4 it shows that ""studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This means that Obama's goal is prevailing. Paris came to a conclusion that they decided to ban driving due to smog. In section 2 it states that Paris air became so polluted that they enforced a parial ""driving ban"" to get rid of the air pollution. They blamed this problem due to the diesel fuel. They figured out that diesels make up 67% of vehicles in France, as to 53% in the rest of Western Eurpoe. In section 2 its pretty much the same reason except Bogota's goal is to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The violators faced 25 fines."" They figured limiting car usage was a good opportunity to take away stress and reduce air pollution. In section 4 the last paragraph tells you what Bill Ford plan was. He wanted to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, onserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" These are some advantages of less car usage. Many good things will start to happen if everyone could lower the usage of cars nowadays. We don't want the world to have polluted air, we don't want to promote car accidents, and we also don't want under age drivers on the streets. So take in mind the disadvantages of usage of cars and compared the to the the advantages of limiting car usage.",0,"why be the street always so jammed everyone ask that all the time almost everyday around 5:00pm the reason for be because car be excessively use nowadays there be several different advantage that can happen when limit car usage the world would be a well place if less car be use on the road

2086,1,"Dear Senator [Your Senator’s Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College system in electing the United States President. Despite the criticism the system often faces, I firmly believe there are compelling practical reasons to maintain it, which largely outweigh the arguments for a direct popular vote election.

The Electoral College, as a process detailed in the Constitution, represents a significant compromise made by the founding fathers between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election by a popular vote of the qualified citizens (1). This formalized structure enhances the certainty of the outcome, and has proven resilient over time despite rare occurrences where the popular vote winner lost the presidency (16, 18). More importantly, it pushes the benefit of trans-regional appeal (19). Presidential candidates must appeal to a diverse range of regions, which ensures that no single region’s interest dominates the Presidential selection. This approach also assists in preventing the creation of a disenfranchised voter base that feels neglected due to regional bias.

Critics might point to seemingly undemocratic tendencies of this system, such as the winner-take-all characteristic in some states and the concentration on the swing states, which many say unfairly influences the election (13, 20). I appreciate the validity of these concerns but argue that these aspects encourage strategic campaigning and political engagements, leading to votes that are frequently thoughtful and informed (20).

Under the Electoral College, larger states receive a due advantage that counteracts the political imbalance created by the Senate’s equal state representation (21). Furthermore, this system inherently prevents the need for complex run-off elections since it consistently produces a clear winner (22). 

The Electoral College system is indeed procedural, complicated, and may at times seem less straightforward than direct popular voting; however, it embodies long-standing traditions and principles that support a balanced, thoughtful, and informed representation of the nation’s diverse population. It approaches the task of electing the highest office with an aspect of fairness that a straight popular vote might threaten to undermine. For these reasons, I hope you'll support the continued existence of the Electoral College in our electoral system.

Thank you for considering my standpoint on this pressing issue. I am confident that our democratic processes, while enduring scrutiny and challenges, will prove to be resilient and stand the test of time.

Subject: The Benefits of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider the advantages it provides in determining the President of the United States. Although there are arguments in favor of moving towards a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our constitutional process and should be retained. This letter presents multiple reasons for keeping the Electoral College, based on the information provided in the accompanying passage text from the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner's defense of the Electoral College.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the 2012 presidential election, Barack Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, even though he only had a 51.3% share of the popular vote. This system guarantees a clear winner and minimizes the likelihood of disputes over the outcome. Furthermore, with almost all states following a winner-take-all approach, even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This promotes stability and avoids the need for run-off elections, as seen in the cases of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity and representation for all regions of the country. A presidential candidate must have trans-regional appeal as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure victory. This ensures that candidates focus on the needs and concerns of a diverse range of states, rather than solely targeting the most populous areas. Additionally, swing states gain prominence in the electoral process, encouraging candidates to address the issues specific to those states. This fosters engagement from voters in those states and helps emphasize their importance in the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance between large and small states. Although the mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states an advantage in terms of representation, the Electoral College allows larger states to have more weight in the electoral process. Due to the winner-take-all method, a victory in a large state, such as Florida, carries significantly more electoral votes than a victory in a smaller state, such as Wyoming. This prevents smaller states from being overlooked and ensures that candidates address the concerns of a wide range of voters across different states.

Lastly, the Electoral College system entices voters to engage in the political process. While critics argue that supporters of candidates who are unlikely to win their state may lose motivation to vote, the truth is that voters participate in elections to express their political preferences, not with the expectation that their vote will decide the outcome. In the 2012 election, nearly half of the eligible American population voted, further exemplifying the commitment of voters to the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system. It provides certainty of outcome, guarantees representation for all regions, promotes engagement with swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there are calls to shift towards a popular vote system, it is essential to consider the benefits and stability provided by the Electoral College. I strongly urge you to vote in favor of preserving this system for the election of the President of the United States.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

1440,1,"I am writing to express my views on the ongoing debate surrounding the Electoral College and the possibility of transitioning to a system based on the popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. This issue has been a subject of considerable discussion, and I believe it is crucial for our democracy to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of both systems.

Firstly, I want to highlight the benefits of retaining the Electoral College. One of the main arguments in favor of this system is that it ensures that smaller states have a voice in the presidential election. The Electoral College allocates electors based on the number of representatives a state has in Congress, which means that even states with smaller populations still play a significant role in the election process. This helps prevent the domination of presidential candidates focusing solely on the concerns of densely populated urban areas, ensuring a more balanced representation of the entire nation.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have a broad appeal across various regions of the country. This is because winning a state outright, rather than just amassing the most popular votes nationwide, is critical. This can lead to a more diverse and inclusive campaign strategy that takes into account the diverse needs and perspectives of different states and regions.

However, it is important to acknowledge the criticisms of the Electoral College. One of the primary concerns is the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the electoral vote, as has happened in a few instances throughout history. This situation raises questions about the fairness and legitimacy of the electoral process, leading some to argue for a shift to a purely popular vote system.

Advocates for a popular vote system argue that it would simplify the election process, making it more straightforward and transparent. Every vote would carry equal weight, and the candidate with the most votes nationwide would secure victory. This, they claim, would eliminate the potential for discrepancies between the popular vote and the electoral vote and promote a more direct form of democracy.

In conclusion, the debate over the Electoral College versus a popular vote system is complex and multifaceted. While the Electoral College has its advantages in ensuring a diverse and balanced representation of the nation, the criticisms of this system cannot be ignored. A shift to a popular vote system may address concerns about fairness and simplicity but could neglect the interests of smaller states. As you consider this issue, I urge you to carefully weigh the pros and cons, keeping in mind the principles of fairness, representation, and the preservation of a truly national election process.

535,0,"How could we get the reduction of Greenhouse Gas? We can simply do this by reducing the number of cars on the road. In the city of Vauban, Germany, they gave up cars completely. If you still own a car in this city you have to buy a large garage that runs to about 40,000. This expense doesn't include your house. Up to 70% of the cities population of 5,500 have given up their motor vehicle. The passenger cars in the city are responsible for 12% of the Greenhouse gas. I believe that if we, in the state of Florida, give up our cars that we can literally save the world.

First, Today in the sunshine state, we love to sit in our air conditioned motor vehicles. We love to take a joy ride by the beach, but do you know the real damage you're doing to our world? In the United States alone we produce about 50% of the greenhouse gas. With how many citizens we have, what would that number be if we cut out all motor vehicles? We would be saving the Earth. How does that make you feel? Like a hero? That's what you would be.

Secondly, We all own houses that cost so much! To be able to park your car you could have to buy a large enough garage, that would be at the end of your country that could cost up to 40,000. Why pay this outrageous amount to be the only one driving around your carfree city? If we do take this commitment on reducing our driving, how would you get to work? This is a common question asked. We would be forced to put work establishments within walking distances.

Lastly, we as americans are one of the most obese countries. We sit in cars and drive around daily. Our government has actually made it even more easy to access fast food, they put in drive threws. Some thought that this awesome, new, cool invention could help us save time, but in reality it just make it more simple to get these bad habits. If we really want to eat these bad foods, we would have to walk there. Thus we would be getting more exercise. Getting rid of cars would be the best thing that has happened to us in a long time.

In conclusion, We need to take a stand and stop all motor vehicles. With these powered automobiles we are damaging the earth with Greenhouse gas, Saving money, and giving us what we need. I believe that this change needs to be made soon, or who knows where we could end up. Lets get all states to get rid of all motor vehicles.",0,"how could we get the reduction of Greenhouse Gas we can simply do this by reduce the number of car on the road in the city of Vauban Germany they give up car completely if you still own a car in this city you have to buy a large garage that run to about 40,000 this expense do n't include your house up to 70 of the city population of 5,500 have give up their motor vehicle the passenger car in the city be responsible for 12 of the Greenhouse gas I believe that if we in the state of Florida give up our car that we can literally save the world

17,0,"Transportation has become one of the largest emissions throughout the world, and many do not seem to wonder how beneficial limiting car usage can be. Not only does the release of fossil fuels harm the world, but the stress that comes with having a vehicle is immense. When considering ownership of a vehicle, one must think about the pros and cons of owning one, and realize that the limited pros... are not worth the cons.

Cars, trucks, and buses have many factors in common, but one in particular is hazardous to mother nature... fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are harming our territory, the place where life has been made possible, Earth. At the streak we are going, soon enough us humans, the domain species won't have a home due to the pollutants vehicles release killing the Ozone Layer. We have become accustomed to the abuse of transportation. Even when we are capable of walking or using a bike to a nearby location, we choose to use a vehicle instead of avoiding the damage that is caused. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" Source 2 states. Their are many ways to distinguish transportation, but one very adequate description is ""a death wish"".

The stress that comes with the ownership of any transporting vehicle surpasses what anyone can bare! The economic standards one needs to posses is difficult.

455,1,"Dear Senator of Florida, I believe the electoral college should be abolished as a process over all. The electoral college should be abolished because it does not benefit the U.S. in anyway and has caused multiple problems in elections over the past years. The electoral college should not be a part of the U.S. Constitution and it only causes issues while elections are present therefore we as a country should elect by popular vote.

The electoral college should be abloshied because it has caused multiple problems over the past years during elections and could continue to cause problems. The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you know, but those electors do not always vote for their parties candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to not always guarantee presidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote but lost presidency because of the electoral college. Not only did one incident occur but multiple occur because of the electoral college. As stated in paragraph 11 of Bradford plumber's article, in 1960 segregationists in louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so if Kennedy got the popular vote he wouldnt have got the presidency. Like Bradford Plumer clearly stated ""the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational."" The electoral college should be abolished so that problems can be eliminated and elections are fair.

The electoral college should not only be abolished, or destroyed, because it causes problems but also because it does not benefit the United States in any way. The outdated, unfair system just hurts the U.S. government and the country as a whole, it does not benefit our government or citizens in anyway what so ever. Under the electoral college system voters are voting for a slate of electors who don't always vote for their own party candidate rather than voting for the candidate they want to govern our country. 60% of voters would prefer direct election and popular vote anyway so why not throw out the old worn down process that docent work and replace it with something the people of this country actually want, popular vote. Some people might say we should keep the electoral college because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee so nothing can happen but according to history things can happen such as in the 2000 election. Why keep a process that the majority of the citizens of this country don't want and a process that just causes issues.

The electoral college is a thing of the past, a has been that almost no one wants around. Popular vote elections would be more fair and will not have mistakes during elections like the huge mistakes the electoral college system has proven to display. The citizens of America want the electoral college gone and popular vote elections should be what the government is aiming for so we do not have mistakes in our elections and so the U.S. can benefit from actually having a working election process.",0,"dear Senator of Florida I believe the electoral college should be abolish as a process over all the electoral college should be abolish because it do not benefit the U.S. in anyway and have cause multiple problem in election over the past year the electoral college should not be a part of the U.S. Constitution and it only cause issue while election be present therefore we as a country should elect by popular vote

2073,0,"Title: Reducing Automobile Dependency: Multiple Benefits for the Community and the Environment

Recently, cities worldwide are recognizing the benefits of reducing car usage and are taking steps to encourage their citizens to adopt alternative modes of transportation. Despite the convenience that cars provide, their disadvantages are numerous, including their contribution to global warming, air pollution, and traffic congestion.

One primary advantage of reducing car usage deals with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Rosenthal, automobiles are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change (Rosenthal 5). The decrease in miles traversed by vehicles in the United States signifies a promising trend towards achieving President Obama's ambition to curb national greenhouse emissions (Rosenthal 32).

The shift from car-centric communities is also visibly improving air quality. Paris experienced a 60 percent decrease in congestion, resulting in a significant decrease of smog after a partial driving ban was imposed (Duffer 14). Moreover, in Columbia's capital city, Bogota, annual car-free days significantly decrease air pollution, offering citizens the experience of calmer, cleaner, and more communal urban spaces (Selsky 21,24).

Reducing automobile dependency fosters community development as well. Vauban, an experimental German suburb, demonstrated that life without cars could promote a more lively and tension-free urban atmosphere (Rosenthal 3). The typical sounds of a bustling neighbourhood have replaced the noise of automobiles, creating a calmer environment for residents. Moreover, the community's strategic planning prioritizes accessibility to public transportation, with stores located within walking distance rather than isolated shopping malls along remote highways (Rosenthal 4,6).

Reducing car usage also cultivates an atmosphere that encourages physical activity. In Bogota, for instance, the car-free day led to the construction of 118 miles of cycling paths, the most in any Latin American city, thereby promoting health and wellness among its citizens (Selsky 27).

Clearly, the dependency on cars can be reduced without compromising the quality of urban life. Instead, it brings numerous benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and stronger communities. This societal shift demands collaborative efforts from individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide to imagine and enact a less car-intensive future. By embracing this challenge, we move towards creating environments that are not only sustainable but also more conducive to our well-being.",1,"title reduce Automobile dependency multiple benefit for the Community and the environment

40,0,"By limiting car usage you would be making it a healther environment, and a safer one!

there would be less pollution in the air and that would make the air better for us to breath.

Sure by limiting the usage of cars would have an effect on people its also doing us a favor wether we like it or not, because constantly breathing in polluted air is really bad for you it can have major affects on our lungs, and respotory system. Also by limiting car usage you wouldent spend so much money on gas, oil, car parts,ect:, so by saving all that money you could spent it on something else.

When you own a vehicle you put in so much money in just getting your insurance and then you spend so much money on gass every week, dont get me wrong the gas prices have gone down but what will happen when they go back up and how much money will the gas be then?

So is driving worth killing your air and the environment you live in and spend all your money on gas?

Or would it better for us to start imiting our car usage?

But that is up for you to decide what you want to do.

Whe driving have you ever thought how much pollution you vehicle is dishing out while your driving around town? Probably not, probably you where thinking how log till i get there or i need to text someone back but i bet not once did car pollution ever cross you mind and its okay not alot of people think about it when there driving. Actually hardly anyone thinks abot it ever unless its on the news saying that the air pollution is bad again and thats when you start to think about it.

With car pollution ypu dont realse what it is dont to you environment because you never see it happen in a fast pace it always happen really slow.

All of a sudden plants will start to die really fast, people will have areally hard time breathing and will probably have to go to the hospital because of the lack of oxygen they can get.

Imagine saving you money, wouldent that be nice not having to worry about a car paymeny or gas?

alot of people would have so much money that alot of them nedd because there is alot of families struggling to make it by the have to constantly worry if they have enough money to pay the bills and put gass in there vehicle to get to work to make the money to survie.

921,0,"The age of cars has come to a grinding stop. Atleast, That's what the general consensus of these 4 articles seems to be. Although current youth do not see car buying as a major thing in their lives right now, it is highly unlikely it will remain as such because of the structure of an average american lifestyle.

Cars are a massive staple of the world and hold many things together and allow for fast, easy, convenient travel. The young people of today do not currently have to use cars to get where they are going because of many factors such as friends with cars, human powered forms of transportation such as bicycles, skateboards, etc.and pareits with cars. Once these children move away from home to a college or to a job elsewhere they will need a car to maintain a normal lifestyle. We are currently in a second babyboom, this means that there are many young people that do not need cars and thus do not have one, swaying the data away from the ""car culture"". While it is true that some people are trying to reduce their ""carbon footprint"" by driving less and using public transportation, the number of them is very small and irrelevant when compared to all people in the world. Cars maintain a large amount of appeal that cannot be found in any other form of transportation: This appeal is that it is your vehicle, to do whatever you want with and be free, it is also easy and convenient to get from place to place, it is a place to hang out with your friends andor a significant other, it is also faster than any other form of transportation short of a helicopter or plane. Cars have so many benefits that people will not just quit driving because of increased carbon emissions, most of which is not entirely the fault of cars.

While cars do put out a large amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, that amount is inconsequential compared to the massive amou its of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanos and by other human creations. One volcanic eruption emits around the same amount of carbon dioxide in a few hours as the entire country of America does in 1015 years. Cars are not the true issue here, the main reason carbon dioxide is on tthe rise is because of the lack of trees and worldwide deforestation. All plant life can convert carbon dioxide into oxygen during photosynthesis, this means that more plant life equals less carbon dioxide. Instead of trying to reduce the number of cars in the world and make life harder on many people, the focus of the world should be to increase the amount of vegetation in the world so as to counterbalance the number of cars in the world.

Cars have long been an important factor in the world social, political, and economical structure. Before the second World War, Fuhrer Adolf Hitler decided that his people needed a cheap, basic car so as to increase Germany's economic prowess. Due to this vision Volkswagen, The people's car, was started. Volkswagen marked the start of cheap, affordable cars for everyday people. Although Germany lost World War II, their technology and ideas diffused to much of the world thanks to American and Soviet research. Their idea of a people's car spread around the world and the 1950's marked the start of massive sprawling suburbs that relied on personal vehicles to get to and from work, the store, school, or anywhere outside of the suburbs. This was a totally new type of lifestyle It wasn't urban life where you could walk or ride a bus wherever you needed, and it wasn't rural where you made everything by hand and didnt travel often. No, this was something entirely new that was brought about because of the advent of cheap affordable personal transportation. Now everyone can get to work relying on only themselves and not bus drivers or train operators, people have a new sense of freedom afforded them by this magnificent new machine, the car.

The same ideas and principles that made cars such an important part of culture and life in the 1950's still remain in our lives today. Cars will remain an important part of world culture until another form of transportation is easier, more convenient, andor cheaper. A car gives its driver a fast, freeing, and flexible form of transportation unparalleled by anything today. Car use should not be limited, it should be encouraged.",0,"the age of car have come to a grind stop atleast that be what the general consensus of these 4 article seem to be although current youth do not see car buying as a major thing in their life right now it be highly unlikely it will remain as such because of the structure of an average american lifestyle

1484,0,"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly clear as cities and communities around the world experiment with new approaches to transportation. One such example is Vauban, a suburb in Germany where cars are not allowed on the streets except for a few designated areas. This experiment has led to numerous benefits for the residents, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and a sense of community and livability.

According to an article in the New York Times, cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, communities like Vauban can make a significant impact on reducing these emissions. The article also mentions that Vauban's streets are peaceful and quiet, with the swish of bicycles and the sound of children playing replacing the noise of car engines.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. Paris, for example, implemented a partial driving ban during a period of smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. The ban targeted even-numbered license plates one day and odd-numbered plates the next, and nearly 4,000 drivers were fined for violating the ban. While there were complaints from delivery companies about lost revenue, exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars with three or more passengers.

Another example of the benefits of limiting car usage can be seen in Bogota, Colombia, which has implemented a car-free day for the past three years. This day encourages alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transportation. The event has been successful in reducing traffic congestion and promoting a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. Other cities in Colombia have also joined in the event, and municipal authorities from other countries have come to witness and learn from the event.

The end of car culture is predicted by many experts, as Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This trend has environmental implications as transportation is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. With advancements in technology and changes in behavior, people are finding alternative means of getting around, such as telecommuting, shared van services, and bike-sharing programs. The decrease in driving by young people is particularly notable, with studies showing a 23 percent decrease between 2001 and 2009.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and a shift towards a more sustainable and livable environment. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota show that it is possible to create thriving communities without cars, and that alternative modes of transportation can be successful and beneficial. As we continue to prioritize the environment and seek ways to reduce our carbon footprint, limiting car usage is a significant step in the right direction.",1,"the advantage of limit car usage be become increasingly clear as city and community around the world experiment with new approach to transportation one such example be Vauban a suburb in Germany where car be not allow on the street except for a few designate area this experiment have lead to numerous benefit for the resident include reduce greenhouse gas emission improve air quality and a sense of community and livability

1138,0,"In America, cars have been an integral part of our culture from the Model T. Ford to the Mustang cars have cemented themselves into our mindset. But currently cars are starting to cause a lot of problems to people such as: car accidents, pollution, and just leaving areas to crowdy. One of the main problems that cars globally cause is smog emission which is caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and can cause difficulty in breathing, lung cancer and rampant air pollution. However, in other parts of the world people are limiting car usage to almost banning them all out completly in certain areas in order to be more environmentally friendly and reducing air pollution. By limiting car usage in America people can benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.

In North America, pollution has been a major problem for citizens in many ways. Besides power plants, the second main source of pollution are cars, as they release harmful chemicals and gases like smog which can cause congestion and when too much and inhaled on a daily basis, can lead to lung cancer. By limiting car usage people can benefit more to the people for example in Paris,France a partial driving ban was enforced in order to clear the air of smog after days of nearrecord pollution. By doing this congestion was brought down by 60 percent helping to majorly clear the air and make breathing better for people.

In Vauban, Germany residents of the area have been called suburban pioneers due to giving up their cars. By doing this people were able to be more happy and enjoy life more. For example, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" this aids the argument that by banning or limiting car usage people are able to be much calmer and benefit more. In Bogota, Colombia during ""Carfree day"" for the first time two colombian cities joined Bogota in this unique event. there more parks and sports centers for people were placed, the sidewalk were smoothe and more business and commercial areas were opened up for people. This further shows that people can benfit greatly without having cars.

Throughout the world wherever cars have been limited or banned there has always been one constant, new alternative transportation. In China in order to help reduce the absurd amount of smog and air pollution, chinese citizens resorted to using bikes leading to a drop in smog levels. By limiting cars and replacing them with alternative transportation people can be much safer from more dangerous situations, such as car acsidents hurting people, keeping dunk drivers away from the steering wheel, and being able to save more money from not buying a car. Though some alternate vehicles are not fast enoguh for example bikes, this has been remedied in some areas by allowing free public transit from buses and taxi services.

Throughout all of these benfits people can benfit more greatly but that's not enough. In 2012 during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford proposed a business plan in where partnering with the telecommunication industry to create cities where ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation trafic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Through bright ideas like the advantages of limiting cars can be fully realized and brought to life in order to help and save more people from negative aftereffects. In America if people were to cut down on car use people could benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.",0,"in America car have be an integral part of our culture from the Model T. Ford to the Mustang car have cement themselves into our mindset but currently car be start to cause a lot of problem to people such as car accident pollution and just leave area to crowdy one of the main problem that car globally cause be smog emission which be cause by the warm layer of air to trap car emission and can cause difficulty in breathing lung cancer and rampant air pollution however in other part of the world people be limit car usage to almost ban they all out completly in certain area in order to be more environmentally friendly and reduce air pollution by limit car usage in America people can benefit from less pollution a more positive community impact and alternative vehicle in place of car

144,1,"What is the electoral college? The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes. The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? The electoral college should be diminished because it is an unfair direct election, and the disaster factor.

To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections. This would help our governmental system because as noted by Richard A. Posner, ""There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast."" By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve runoff elections. What we dont know is if it will permanently work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk? The electors are the ones voting for the president, so we should question whether they should have control to help avoid these runoff elections. The writer notes, ""... the pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral college..."" Posner. Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and one benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college.

Moreover, the disaster factor has a huge impact on the electoral collage. The writer states, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse"" Plumer. This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system. According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again. The writer also says, ""electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" Plumer. This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky. The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.

Not only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election. As stated in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""... when you vote for your candidate you are acually voting for your candidate's electors."" Office of the Federal Register. This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country. That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters"" as well as ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" Plumer. Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government. The writer also notes, ""candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" Plumer. This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries government. Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster?

All in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.",0,"what be the electoral college the electoral college be a process which consist of the selection of the elector meet where they vote for president and the counting of the vote the real question be be the electoral college help we or be it just bring our government far towards disaster the electoral college should be diminish because it be an unfair direct election and the disaster factor

406,0,"Many people do not rely on their cars to take them places anymore in Vauban, Germany. vaughn's streets are completely ""carfree"" Source 1 Paragraph 2. 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars. They are allowed to own cars, but they have to park it at a car garage that they also have to pay for. Heidrun Walter, a mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" These are only a few examples of the advantages of not owning a car or limited car use. Because of this new trend, there are stores, malls, and building closer to people's homes instead of on highways and an hour away. This way, people don't have to walk twenty miles to get to the nearest store.

Another issue that will encourage people to stop driving is smog. In Paris, they enforced a partial driving ban to the clear the air from all the automobiles' gases and pollution toxins. On Monday, car owners with evennumbered license plates were forced not to drive or they'd suffer a 31 dollar fine. They same would happen to the oddnumbered license plate drivers on Tuesday and so on. People rebelled and resulted in 4,000 driver fines. On the bright side, traffic or congestion was down 60 percent. People can get to their destinations a lot faster without all the traffic and congestion. People can save the planet and their jobs.

Not only can people save the planet and traffic jam, but now they have a reason to exercise and get to their destination in time. They can even plan special family activities on a boring Monday. The residents of Bogota, Columbia have taken this into consideration by avoiding traffic by hiking, biking, skating, or even taking the local bus. There is so many advantages to not using a car as transportation. Everyone can ride their bike to school or work or the mall knowing that there is no added pollution, exercise is done for the day, save money, no traffic. What could be better? Not even rain stopped the residents of Bogota.

Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" as he rode a twoseat bike with his wife. People saw and took advantage of this opportunity as well and joined the event. People are crossing borders to see this revolutionary change that these people are making. Reconstruction has taken place too on the uneven sidewalks for bikers, and upscale restaurants and stores have moved up.

People also don't have the choice of getting a car, due to unemployment and their balance. Which supports an advantage of saving money. Americans spend for 50 dollars for gas for their cars to last them for just two weeks, or less. Not to mention the car payment each month. What about the people who can't afford car insurance? No one would need to worry about these things if they just forgot about cars and moved everything closer to their homes.

There are many advantages in not owning or using a car. It can save the planet, energize people, people can exercise everyday without coming up with an excuse why they didn't go to the gym or go for a jog. The best advantag is saving money.

288,1,"The electoral college, despite being established by the constitution, is a corruptible system that should be abolished. The ultimate duty of the government is to protect and serve the people of America, yet our votes must go through this extra step to pick what will ultimately affect us most.

When we vote, we choose who will be running our affairs for the next four years. America needs a president who can govern us in this world of problems, so why would the system overlook portions of the public? What keeps the Members of the college in line with public interests? there is too much instability in the college for it to always align with the best interest of the American people because in its ""winner takes all"" policy it overlooks all members of that state who voted otherwise. The college looks at us like divided pieces, when we really are a whole puzzle. For example, when the majority of floridian vote for one candidate, while just over half of the population of Texas votes for the other, looking at these two states only texas would win, despite more people in total voting for the other candidate. This may not seem like a common occurrence, as article three stated it has happened only twice since 1888, but there is nothing to keep such actions from progressing.

What service does the Electoral college serve that the people cannot? its only purpose in the government is to elect the president. The public, however, is the life and soul of America. The government exists solely to keep order among us. There is no reason why a popular vote wouldn't show the best interest of the people, and a popular vote doesn't overlook any vote.

The greatest problems lie with the tiebreakers, because inthe event of a tie, the election's result goes to the legislature. a few people in congress are looking to fuel their own desires. when presented with the chance to earn more money, they would rather choose the option that will earn them more, even if it means going against the interest of the public.

The electoral college isn't a complete public enemy, however. The electoral votes are decided based upon a popular vote, so they reflect the public's interest, if a little distorted. Maine and Nebraska have an alternate setup of ""proportional representation"" as explained in article one.

879,1,"In America, presidents are voted in by the electoral college. The electoral college is a process of electors from all the states that vote for the president and vice president. There are 538 electors, and you need 270 votes of that 538 to be elected. The electoral college is how we have been electing all of the presidents in America, but the president ought to be elected by a majority vote of the people, not by some fascist in a room voting for us.

Furthermore, the office of the federal register gladly explains the process of the electoral college and it has some holes. bradford Plumer explains in his article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even The best laid defenses are wrong"" says ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" He goes on and exemplifies the fact that the way the votes are cast and counted could be in fact more individually based. Maybe Mr. Plumer is wrong and the electoral college is the best thing for us, but, most people would agree that if we could all vote and have every individual vote counted, we would have a fair election and the true winner would be voted in.

Perhaps in ""Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, an electoral college would be good to have because of run off and big states and so forth. But plainly put, if we could just count voters as people of one nation, not individual states, we could have an efficient running election. For example: say there is 300 million people in America and the president needed 150,000,001 votes to win, then the majority rules factor can be initiated and there will be no run off, no problems with big states, no problem with swing states, and the certainty of outcome of everyone's president will be decided by majority.

Last but not least, all of the authors of the articles have great arguments and have concluded as so. ""what have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of commerce, and the AFLCIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" Bradford Plumer couldnt have summarized it better. If former presidents and other powerful organizations can can agree on abolishing the outdated electoral college then why cant we just get rid of it.

Finally, the electoral college is an old and untrustworthy system of lection currently used in the united states. perhaps if we could try the majority rules and have every legal voter counted as an individual, the election process would be more faithful. All in all, with time comes changes, and with chnges comes broad new spectrums of possibilities.

44,0,"Have you ever wondered what will happen if we keep using cars as a means of transportation? All the air pollution, killing the atmosphere, wasting valuable resources. The future is going to be a place where we can't even breathe in air without having a mask on our heads due to smog. Going green as in limiting cars is a tremendous idea for the communities, and for the planet for various reasons. No smog in the atmosphere, greener communities, and more beneficial ways of transportation. Once you go green you will go never back.

To start off, Smog is one of the main disadvantages of owning or being in heavily populated area where they use cars frequently. Smog is when the cars emit there gases out of there tailpipe, and get trapped in the atmosphere causing people to have problems breathing. Articles in the city of Paris in France said that they had to ban cars due to the smog in the atmosphere. They hit a near record of air pollution and stopped people form using there cars on certain days to clear the smog from the atmosphere. On that five day period of the intensifying smog actually rivaled the place of Beijing, China which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Once the smog cleared they rescind the ban of car usage only to be a the same place there are going to be now if they keep on using cars.

In addition, cities around the world are creating new communities where they are not allowed to use cars. In Vauban, Germany the residents there are in a set up where they cannot use cars in there everyday life. 70 percent of the people over there do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move into the community. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrum Walter, a resident of the city. Other places in the world like in Bogota, Colombia is in a program that they cannot use cars in there life. The life were they are no cars is a good life for a community and for everyone else.

Lastly, the end of transportion is not done, but people are finding new ways of transportation. Newer ways of transportation has stared in New York they have a bikesharing program has skyrocketed. As well as car pooling since only one car or van is being used rather than 4 of 5 cars it is more efficient. People in the United states are using these ideas in there everyday life. Sutdies have shown that are less likely to get their drivers liscense and get a car. The world will be in a better place without car usage.

To summerize, limiting car usage is a extrodinary idea to make the world a better place. To cease the air pollution of smog, to make greener communities, and to make efficent ways of transportation.",0,"have you ever wonder what will happen if we keep use car as a means of transportation all the air pollution kill the atmosphere waste valuable resource the future be go to be a place where we ca n't even breathe in air without have a mask on our head due to smog go green as in limit car be a tremendous idea for the community and for the planet for various reason no smog in the atmosphere greener community and more beneficial way of transportation once you go green you will go never back

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and constituent, I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method used to elect the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College continues to be the most effective and fair approach for a variety of reasons.

One of the primary reasons to maintain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the President has a clear mandate and legitimacy, reducing the likelihood of disputes and challenges to the election results.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election. With each state having a certain number of electors, candidates are compelled to campaign in all states, including those with smaller populations. This prevents candidates from exclusively focusing on heavily populated urban areas and ensures that the concerns and interests of all Americans are taken into account.

In addition, the Electoral College serves to protect the interests of smaller states and less populated regions. It balances the weight that large states hold due to their representation in the House of Representatives, providing a fair voice to states with smaller populations. This helps to prevent the domination of the presidency by a few highly populated states, ensuring a more geographically diverse leadership.

Another advantage of the Electoral College system is its ability to prevent run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges, avoiding the need for costly and time-consuming run-offs. This allows for a more efficient and streamlined election process, ultimately benefiting the American people.

While some argue that the popular vote system would be more democratic, it is important to note that the Electoral College remains a representative process. When we cast our votes for a presidential candidate, we are actually voting for a slate of electors who will then make the final decision. This indirect method of selection allows for the consideration of regional interests and ensures that our democracy remains balanced and fair.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has served our nation well for over two centuries, providing a stable and equitable method for electing the President. It creates certainty in the outcome, gives a voice to all regions of the country, protects the interests of smaller states, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is a system that balances democracy and representation, ensuring that the President is elected in a way that is fair, legitimate, and reflective of the diverse interests of our nation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College and vote in favor of maintaining this vital component of our democracy.

Sincerely,

 in addition the Electoral College serve to protect the interest of small state and less populated region it balance the weight that large state hold due to their representation in the House of Representatives provide a fair voice to state with small population this help to prevent the domination of the presidency by a few highly populate state ensure a more geographically diverse leadership 

 another advantage of the Electoral College system be its ability to prevent run off election in case where no candidate receive a majority of the popular vote the Electoral College ensure that a clear winner emerge avoid the need for costly and time consume run off this allow for a more efficient and streamlined election process ultimately benefit the american people 

 while some argue that the popular vote system would be more democratic it be important to note that the Electoral College remain a representative process when we cast our vote for a presidential candidate we be actually vote for a slate of elector who will then make the final decision this indirect method of selection allow for the consideration of regional interest and ensure that our democracy remain balanced and fair 

 in conclusion the Electoral College have serve our nation well for over two century provide a stable and equitable method for elect the President it create certainty in the outcome give a voice to all region of the country protect the interest of small state focus campaign effort on swing state and avoid the need for run off election it be a system that balance democracy and representation ensure that the President be elect in a way that be fair legitimate and reflective of the diverse interest of our nation

1487,0,"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing trend in many countries to limit the use of cars as a means of transportation. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use. There are numerous advantages to limiting car usage, which include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study mentioned in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to rely less on cars and instead use alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can significantly reduce these emissions. This is crucial in combating climate change and its associated impacts.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. The passage set mentions how cities like Paris have enforced driving bans in response to high levels of pollution. Car emissions, particularly those from diesel fuel, contribute to the release of harmful pollutants into the air. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting alternative transportation options, we can significantly decrease air pollution and improve the overall quality of the air we breathe.

Additionally, limiting car usage promotes a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. By using alternative modes of transportation such as walking or cycling, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This not only improves overall fitness levels but also reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Furthermore, reducing car usage contributes to the development of more walkable and bike-friendly communities, encouraging people to be more active and leading to a decrease in sedentary behavior.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to a more sustainable future. As the passage set explains, car-dependent suburbs in the United States and other countries are not feasible in the long term. By adopting smart planning principles and creating compact communities with less space devoted to parking, we can reduce the need for car ownership and promote the use of public transportation. This would not only result in less traffic congestion but also lead to more efficient land use and a reduction in urban sprawl.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement of air quality, promotion of a healthier lifestyle, and contribution to a more sustainable future. It is important for individuals and communities to embrace alternative modes of transportation and adopt smart planning principles to create a more environmentally friendly and livable society. By working together to limit car usage, we can contribute to a healthier planet for future generations.",1,"the advantage of limit car usage

Subject: In Support of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the continued utilization of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While many argue for changing to a system of popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College has numerous benefits that warrant its preservation.

First and foremost, the Electoral College offers certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As proven by historical data, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the national popular vote. This ensures that a single state or region does not have undue influence in electing the President. This principle is crucial to maintaining a fair and equitable democratic process.

Furthermore, the use of the Electoral College ensures that the President is chosen with trans-regional appeal. No single region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to elect a President, effectively preventing a candidate with only regional support from assuming office. This requirement encourages presidential candidates to campaign across the nation, taking into consideration the interests and concerns of all American citizens.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes under the Electoral College system also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This increases voter engagement and ensures that candidates dedicate their time and resources to listening and addressing the concerns of voters in these pivotal states. In turn, this leads to a more informed electorate and a greater likelihood of presidential candidates making well-rounded and inclusive decisions.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a balance in political power between large and small states. By awarding electoral votes based on population, larger states maintain the weight they deserve in the political process. This balance is essential to prevent a tyranny of the majority and to promote fairness and representation across the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the presidential election process. With this system, a clear winner is determined, even if they do not have a majority of the popular vote. This ensures stability in the election process and prevents prolonged uncertainty and further division among the American people.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states they deem 'unwinnable,' it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, regardless of the Electoral College system. People vote to express their political preferences, not solely in hopes of swinging a national election with a single vote.

In conclusion, it is clear that the Electoral College provides several advantages that foster a fair and balanced presidential election process. Its ability to produce a clear winner, promote trans-regional appeal, enhance voter engagement, balance political power, and avoid run-off elections make it a valuable institution in our democracy. I urge you to preserve the Electoral College and advocate for its continued use in the selection of the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and its citizens.

904,0,"Cars are creating an harmful environment with problems such as smog and traffic. Reduction on car usage can help these problems. Although cars may be a faster transportation, they add on to the havoc of the environment. Reducing car usage has many advantages. It would help develop a better environment and improve people's well being.

An advantage of reduction of car usage is it helps develop a better environment to live in. Some areas which have cars create a lot of smog which is unhealthy for the environment. For example, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog"" Duffer. Smog is formed by cold nights and warm days which causes the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Without so many cars, this issue can decrease. It will help the environment progress and be safer for everyone. Statistics show that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Rosenthal. Cars are causing air pollution. If cars are still the dominant transportation, the environment will still suffer from air pollution such as smog. It's safer to use a large vehicle such as a bus to get around because a bus can hold many more people than a car and would ultimately give off less gas than the population of people who use cars. Another safe way around town would be vehicles which don't give off gases into the air such as bicycles. A safer environment is a better environment.

Another advantage of reduction of cars is improvement of people's well being. With air pollution from cars, humans inhale toxic gases which can be detrimental to their bodies. If car usage plunders, people's bodies will feel better. A businessman said ""It's good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" Plaza. Lowering the number of cars being used helps relieve stress. Nobody wants to be stressed out from traffic or being late to work. With cars there is always a place where there is traffic. Ultimately, reduction of car usage has numerous effects that benefit the society. A media trainer and mother of two stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Walter. Without a car, you don't have to worry about being severely injured since most of the population would transfer to the use of bikes or walking. Because the population would start a trend of riding bikes and walking, most of the roadways would now be unecessary to have and they could be built into something fundamental such as a park, a housing area, or a food market. There would be less worries altogether and this could be more beneficial to the society.

There are many positive effects from reducing car usage. Environment will progress and people's well being will improve. It's beneficial for everyone to limit the use of cars and find other transportation. There would be a safer environment from less smog and rushhour restrictions. Also, the environment will be peoplefriendly from more parks and sports centers.

1521,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Car usage has become an integral part of suburban life in many parts of the world. However, the increasing concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and the negative impacts of car culture on the environment have led to a growing movement to limit car usage. This essay will explore the advantages of restricting car usage based on the information provided in the passages. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to promoting alternative transportation methods and improving public health, limiting car usage can create a more sustainable and livable future for all.

Body Paragraph 1:
One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Passage 5 supports this idea by stating that passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of emissions both in Europe and the United States. By limiting the number of cars on the road, especially in suburban areas, where cars are the primary mode of transportation, we can see a significant decrease in carbon emissions. Passage 29 suggests that recent studies in the United States show a decline in car usage, indicating a cultural shift that can positively impact the environment.

Body Paragraph 2:
Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation methods. Passage 22 describes how Bogota, Colombia implemented a car-free day to encourage the use of buses, bikes, and walking. The participation and enthusiasm of the residents demonstrate that people are willing to embrace alternative means of transportation when given the opportunity. By limiting car usage, we create an environment that is more conducive to public transportation, cycling, and walking. This shift can reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and create more connected communities.

Body Paragraph 3:
Limiting car usage can also have significant benefits for public health. Passage 11 highlights the driving ban enforced in Paris due to smog pollution. The resulting decrease of congestion reduced pollution levels and improved air quality. Passage 13 suggests that congestion in Paris was reduced by 60 percent during the ban. Similar initiatives in cities like Bogota, as mentioned in Passage 26, have also shown positive results in reducing traffic congestion. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative transportation methods, we can minimize air pollution, which has a direct impact on respiratory health and overall well-being.

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative transportation methods, and improving public health. The information presented in the passages supports the idea that a cultural shift towards less car-dependent lifestyles is occurring. By adopting smart planning techniques, creating car-reduced communities, and improving public transportation infrastructure, we can create a more sustainable future. It is important for citizens to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and support initiatives that promote alternative transportation methods. Together, we can work towards a greener, healthier, and more connected society.",1,"title the advantage of limit car usage

728,0,"Although we rely on cars as a primary means of transportation for our busy lives there are many advantages to not using as much or even having them at all. Now driving in a car is very useful. It gets us where we want to go much faster than just biking or walking there. But there are many benefits and advantages to a world without cars. One advantage is that there will be less polution in the world. Another is that people will be just a little less lazy. And even more is that the world may be just a little quieter and safer with the lack of cars.

Thousands and thousands of people today are either driving a car or some other motorized means of transportation. And though yes they do provide a fasts way to get around, they give off so much exhaust into our relatively clean air and pollute it that its almost toxic to breathe in some places. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" it says that ""After days or nearrecord polution, Paris enforced a patial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Cars polluted the air so badly that in some places people completly banned them all together just to rid their air of the filth that the cars had created.

Many people in the world today have gotten lazier and cars have helped them get this way. Rather than ride a bike to their destination or even walk people decide to be lazy. They drive their car there or take a bus or taxi. But if people have to get up and walk to their destination rather than just walk to their cars it will make the world just a little bit better of a place to live. There may even be less stress in the world. No waiting in traffic and no yelling at others when they cut you off or drive too slow. The only problem or stress you may have to worry about is the crowd of people you may be walking with.

Now yet another advantage to a life without cars is that it will be quieter and safer. There won't be any honking of horns in your ears. There will not be any more roars of engines. No more yelling at other drivers for their ""lack of skill"" at driving. The world will be safer as well. No more people getting hit by cars while walking and no more car accidents. No more police car chases that put innocent civilians in danger of getting hit.

There are many advantages in life with no cars. A world without cars is less polluted. A world without cars is less stressfull. and it makes the world quieter and much safer. Cars are a basic part of life and we have grown used to them but the world may be a little better if they were no longer here.",0,"although we rely on car as a primary mean of transportation for our busy life there be many advantage to not use as much or even have they at all now drive in a car be very useful it get we where we want to go much fast than just bike or walk there but there be many benefit and advantage to a world without car one advantage be that there will be less polution in the world another be that people will be just a little less lazy and even more be that the world may be just a little quieter and safe with the lack of car

768,0,"Although the usage of motorized vehicles such as cars and motorcycles still remains at large, there is a significant amount of the global population that have realized the advantages of limited automobile usage. Cars and other diesel or gasoline dependant vehicles emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, which eventually lead to the progression of global warming. Not only this, but whether we notice it or not, cars and the spaces that are required to house cars take up valuable space that we can use for agriculture, the stimulation of the economy through the purchase of goods, even for progression of our education. The using of motorized vehicles is not something that should be banned by suburban life, but it, like its predecessor the transportation means by horse hauling has started to become obsolete.

As shown by Vauban, Germany, a community in which the usage of cars is virtually nonexistent, the extinction of car usage is something to be welcomed like a weight being lifted off the responsible shoulders of your average driver. Driving is not only a what is now viewed as a necessary activity for daily living, but it is also a hazardous chore that we as common citizens must place on ourselves on a borderline daily basis. When driving, we are subjecting our safety to the hands of chance, leaving our lives susceptible to being taken from us by an irresponsible driver, someone who we will most likely never cross paths with again.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" says a member of the carfree community Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Aside from health related deaths, death by car accident is not something that is unheard of, it is actually one of the top theives of life found in the United States alone. It is estimated that a death of a teenager ages 1620 resulting from a car accident happens every 16 seconds. Without cars to drive, there would be no way these accidents may occur.

Within the last century, the rate of global warming has skyrocketed in an almost terrifying way. The natural process that would normally take several millennia to take place without the interference made by humans has been nearly cut by threequarters with the technological advancements that we as a species have made. In three of the four sources, it has shown that the emissions made by fossil fuel dependant vehicles have been the biggest contribution to the advancement of global warming. It is even shown in the article written by Robert Duffer that even a partial ban of car usage in Paris was able to reduce the amounts of smog there significantly.

In two of the articles, it has been shown that with the reduction of car usage, the space that was once consumed completely by these motorized psychological traps can be used to further flourish our enviornment with shopping malls, schools, parks and health centers that are readily available to us. Although we may not notice on a regular basis, but the amount of space that is used to give drivers a place to drive and to give cars a place to inhabit is more than likely bigger than the amount of space that we give an average citizen to live in. In Vauban, Germany 5,500 residents are able to live within a rectangular square mile, whereas a majority of that space in a place like Miami, Florida would be made vacant in terms of living, but prosperous in terms of space taken up by cars. In Bagota, Columbia as a result from their yearly ""Carfree day"" has increased their amount of publicly availabel park and sports center, and have also improved the sidewalks that are readily available to its citizens.

Physical activity has always been promoted, since we were small children who are incapable of driving. Some would say that we were conditioned to view exercise as the best alternative to driving, and it turns out that our conditioning has been proven as fruitful. Within the last several years, the amount of miles driven per person has decreased by nine percent as shown in the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the amount of those looking to receive their driver's liscense has also decreased. This is not because the generation of millennials has viewed driving as something not to their interest, but because we are conditioned to not want to partake in it. Even if our conditioning was not intentional, it has proven fruitful in terms of the improvement of our awareness of both human lives and the enviornment. Both cars and driving are making their way to ineffeciency, and that is not a bad thing. The lack of cars on the road is something to look forward to, both for our ability to look forward to new technological advancements in transportation and for our longevity as a species.",0,"although the usage of motorize vehicle such as car and motorcycle still remain at large there be a significant amount of the global population that have realize the advantage of limited automobile usage car and other diesel or gasoline dependant vehicle emit large amount of greenhouse gas which eventually lead to the progression of global warming not only this but whether we notice it or not car and the space that be require to house car take up valuable space that we can use for agriculture the stimulation of the economy through the purchase of good even for progression of our education the using of motorized vehicle be not something that should be ban by suburban life but it like its predecessor the transportation mean by horse hauling have start to become obsolete

 physical activity have always be promote since we be small child who be incapable of drive some would say that we be condition to view exercise as the good alternative to driving and it turn out that our conditioning have be prove as fruitful within the last several year the amount of mile drive per person have decrease by nine percent as show in the article write by Elisabeth Rosenthal the amount of those look to receive their driver 's liscense have also decrease this be not because the generation of millennial have view drive as something not to their interest but because we be condition to not want to partake in it even if our conditioning be not intentional it have prove fruitful in term of the improvement of our awareness of both human life and the enviornment both car and driving be make their way to ineffeciency and that be not a bad thing the lack of car on the road be something to look forward to both for our ability to look forward to new technological advancement in transportation and for our longevity as a specie"

I hope this finds you well. I write to you as a concerned constituent about an issue that defines our democracy: the institution of the Electoral College. While the system has been criticized as undemocratic and outdated, I argue that it still holds significant relevance in preserving fairness and stability in presidential elections.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and by a popular vote (Passage 1). Not just a place, but an intricate process involving the selection of electors, their voting for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

Opponents of the Electoral College point to the possibility of the popular vote winner losing the presidency due to an imbalance of electoral votes (Passage 9). Indeed, there have been instances where this has happened, two times since 1888, to be precise (Passage 16). However, these cases are extremely rare and should not be the basis for dismantling a centuries-old system. 

Judge Richard A. Posner, in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" outlines several practical reasons for its preservation. Posner points to the system's tendency to provide a ""Certainty of Outcome"" as one of its key benefits (Passage 17). The Electoral College invariably delivers clear outcomes by awarding a majority of its votes to the winning candidate (Passage 18). The winner-take-all system ensures a definite result, whereas a direct popular vote might be riddled with disputes and recount requests.

Furthermore, the Electoral College forces presidential candidates to broaden their appeal beyond regional boundaries (Passage 19). The necessity of securing electoral votes in various regions prevents a candidate from winning through concentrated regional popularity, thereby encouraging a nation-wide campaign promoting unity and cohesion. This system also directs candidates' focus onto swing states where voters are likely to pay close attention to the campaign, ensuring the most thoughtful voters decide the election (Passage 20).

While it is true that the system tends to favor larger states, this can be viewed as a reset of the political balance that large states lose because of the Senate's mal-apportionment, as Posner argues (Passage 21). The inevitability of a clear outcome helps to avoid run-off elections, simplifying the electoral process (Passage 22).

Some criticisms of the Electoral College are valid, such as with respect to its potential to discourage voters in states dominated by the opposite political affiliation. However, I believe we could remedy this through reforms such as those adopted by Maine and Nebraska which have a ""proportional representation"" system, rather than entirely uprooting the Electoral College.

I urge you to consider the arguments presented while contemplating reforms in our election process. While the electoral college may indeed seem antiquated in some regards, it remains critical to maintaining a unified, nation-wide focus in our Presidential elections.

I look forward to hearing your viewpoint on this matter.

2085,1,"Dear Senator [Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you as a concerned citizen of our state concerning the present means by which we elect the President of the United States - the Electoral College. This subject has been contentious for decades and today, I wish to voice my support for it, maintaining that we should continue to elect our President through this process as opposed to adopting a direct popular vote.

The Electoral College, as stated by the Office of the Federal Register, was established as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election by popular vote [1]. It involves the selection of electors, who then cast votes for the President and Vice President - thereby presenting a method for balanced representation [2]. 

I acknowledge the criticism against the Electoral College. Critics, like Bradford Plumer, argue that it is an anachronistic system that can distort the true will of the people via the “disaster factor” and ignores voters' preferences in non-swing states [11, 13]. Plumer, and others, favor moving to a system of direct democracy where the candidate with the most popular votes wins the presidency. However, I argue that retaining the Electoral College has crucial benefits that outweigh the identified cons.

Judge Richard A. Posner, a renowned legal scholar, presents five compelling reasons for retaining the Electoral College. Firstly, the Electoral College offers certainty of outcome. As Posner points out, the likelihood of a dispute over the popular vote is more pronounced as contrasted with an Electoral College vote, due to the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeding his share of the popular vote [18].

Secondly, the electoral system ensures the President-elect has trans-regional appeal. The election winner must appeal to a broad range of regions, implying a candidate's message should cater more universally, advocating for national unity [19]. 

Thirdly, the system encourages focus on swing states that often bear varied demographics, which inadvertently promotes the representation of a broad array of voters' interests [20]. 

Lastly, it also addresses the challenge of unequal representation in the Senate by giving more political weight to large states, [21] and dodges the issue of run-off elections by creating a system that usually delivers a distinctive winner without necessitating run-offs [22].

I acknowledge that no system is flawless. However, the benefits of the Electoral College - promoting national unity, mitigating election crisis, preserving balanced representation, and fostering a robust democracy - outweigh its pitfalls. 

Thank you for your consideration of my perspective on this matter. I would appreciate any thoughts you have regarding the Electoral College debate.

680,1,"America was built upon the foundation known as democracy, yet we have been desecrating on what we believe in for years. I am talking about the electoral college, the process of picking a president or senator through voting for what an elector decides on and acts as a representative for what a certain region decides to vote for. From the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral vites by Congress."" I do not believe that the electoral college is a wise decision as it being the process of voting for our next leader.

Many people disagree with my opinion and there are a few reasons why, that even I support. From the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president,"" by Richard A. Posner, he states that the outcome is certain when applying electoral college to a vote, while a dispute can be more likely to occur using the popular vote method. However, the electoral college can even decrease the percentage of voters in the country. There are Democrats in Texas while California has Republicans. This means that there are electors who already know what they're voting for and the candidates only visit ""swing"" states or states who have no preference on what party they are voting for. This will decrease the chance of voters to vote in a state that already knows what party the electors of their state will vote for.

I agree on the basis that vote by popular election is more applicable to the situation of voting rather than by electoral college. One reason is the messup that occurred on the presidential election voting in 2000. The problems of the electoral college is the reason why Florida screwed up and George Bush became president rather than Al Gore, who won the popular vote. Taken from the Article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumer,""Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote, but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Another reason as stated by Plumer's article,""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What would happen if there is a tie on the votes the elector gets? Would the elector simply choose one or the other or might not even vote at all. I also believe that it is unfair that each state gets the number of electors based on the population of the state. If California was Republican while Idaho could be for Democrats, then both do not have an equal value because California has more people. Overall, electoral college seems sophisticated but whatever happened to being ""plain and simple?"".

Voting through the popular vote method seems much easier and much better than voting within a certain region counts as one vote. It would be much simpler if every vote of every single person counted as it's own vote for the president, not for an elector. This makes your vote not seem that worthy and is the cause of discouragement of voting. From the Office of the Federal Register it states that, ""Most states have a ""winnertakeall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" There is proportional representation or statistics involved, simply who gets more takes it and it would be unfair to each person with this method.

In conclusion, the electoral college is an outdated process for electing a president and should be changed to whoever, wins the popular vote because deepdown, the people are the key figure in voting. With this process, you are undermining you, your state, and even your country by continuing with this absurd and unnescessary process when it could be all voted and decided, ""by the people and for the people.",0,"America be build upon the foundation know as democracy yet we have be desecrate on what we believe in for year I be talk about the electoral college the process of pick a president or senator through vote for what an elector decide on and act as a representative for what a certain region decide to vote for from the Office of the Federal Register the Electoral College consist of the selection of the elector the meeting of the elector where they vote for President and Vice President and the counting of the electoral vite by Congress I do not believe that the electoral college be a wise decision as it be the process of vote for our next leader

1151,0,"Car, bikes, walking and such are many forms of transportation. Cars are the main favorite overall. But as time continues we see that the drastic need for cars is growing smaller and smaller because we are now seeing the bigger picture limiting car usage is a bigger plus than a negative.

In Vauban,German the suburb is going ""carfree"". Rosenthal speaks about how Vauban allows cars but there are only two locations where they may park these cars. If you want to park your car you must buy a space for 40,000, and a home along with your parking space. Due to these facts 70% of Vauban families do not own a car. An advantage of this limited car usage is that people like Heidrum Walter speak about how she is much happier and less tense without her car.

Vauban is in an area that is more accessible to public transportation and closer to stores. The closeness allows people easier accessablity to buses, or walking and biking places. With everything close its easier to get to point A to B. Also reduces pollution and greenhouse gases due to the fact they aren't using cars to get to there locations.

In Source 2 Duffer, speaks about how in Paris bans are being placed against the usage against cars, due to the fact Paris has a high level of smog. Paris had motorists with evennumbered license plates on Mondays leave there cars home or suffer a fine. On Tuesday motorists with oddnumbered license plates were to leave cars home or suffer a fine. The advantage of this ban is that having so many people leave there cars home on Monday allowed the smog to clear enough that the ban for Tuesday was rescind. If Paris were to do this ban for a couple of years there smog issue would be completely gone. This would be a major advantage for them, it would give them less pollution, not as many people getting sick due to the smog, and a less car dependent city.

An event was created in Bogota, Colombia called A Day Without Cars. Which was to have people go carfree for a day. Colombians used many other transportations such as biking, buses, and hiking. This event allowed smog to be reduced due to the fact Colombians could not use a car this day or be fined. Also this event helped spark other areas want to pertake in this event. This was a huge advantage having many other places join A Day Without Cars this meant more areas helping reduce smog and helping many more areas become aware of the fact cars dont have to be the only form of transportation people use.

All in all if areas become less car dependent, there shall be less smog, pollutions and lastly people wont have to travel as far due to the fact everything will be closer. The smaller amount of cars we have, the more positive outcomes.",0,"car bike walking and such be many form of transportation car be the main favorite overall but as time continue we see that the drastic need for car be grow small and small because we be now see the big picture limit car usage be a big plus than a negative

258,1,"Dear State Senator, In my opinion, Im in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. At first I was all for keeping the Electoral College. But after reading the reasons why we shouldn't keep it I completly agree that we should change it.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" So basically the electoral college doesn't give a fair chance to voters and that's not right. All voters in every state should get a fair chance. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!""

""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we migh call the disaster factor. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This is an example: ""In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.

Subject: Support for the Preservation of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [State Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the preservation of the Electoral College in the process of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for several compelling reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As mentioned in the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election's outcome. With the winning candidate needing to secure a majority of electoral votes, the system provides a clear winner and minimizes the chances of a tie or inconclusive election.

In addition, the Electoral College guarantees that the elected president represents the entire nation. Judge Posner states that the Electoral College requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no region alone has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that candidates need to campaign and garner support from various regions, ensuring that the president represents the interests of a diverse range of citizens. If we were to switch to a popular vote system, candidates may focus their campaigns on densely populated areas, neglecting the needs and concerns of citizens in less populated regions. By maintaining the Electoral College, we promote a more balanced and inclusive representation of the American people.

The Electoral College also emphasizes the importance of swing states, which is crucial for fostering a well-informed electorate. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" Judge Posner mentions how the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on swing states. This ensures that voters in these states pay close attention to the candidates' campaigns and policies, fostering a more thoughtful and informed electorate. This plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and quality of our democracy.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a vital check on the influence of large states. According to Judge Posner, the Electoral College restores some weight to large states in the political balance that they lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By awarding electoral votes proportionately to each state's population, the system ensures that candidates cannot solely rely on the support of densely populated states. This prevents candidates from exclusively catering to the needs and interests of those living in highly populous areas, making the presidency more accessible to citizens across the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complexities of run-off elections. As Judge Posner points out, the Electoral College produces a clear winner, even when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This eliminates the need for time-consuming and potentially costly run-off elections that may further divide the nation. The Electoral College streamlines the election process by providing a decisive outcome and allows the country to move forward promptly.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters, as mentioned in the passage ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" by Bradford Plumer, statistics show that a significant portion of the eligible population still exercises their right to vote. Voters participate in the election to express their political preference rather than with the expectation that their individual vote will determine the outcome. This suggests that the Electoral College does not discourage engagement or interest in the electoral process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a fundamental role in our democratic system by ensuring certainty of outcome, fostering a representative presidency, encouraging a well-informed electorate, providing a balance of power between states, and avoiding the complexities of run-off elections. For these reasons, I implore you to support the preservation of the Electoral College. It is essential for maintaining a strong and inclusive democracy that represents the diverse interests and needs of all American citizens.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully weigh the benefits of the Electoral College and make an informed decision that upholds the principles of fairness and representation in our electoral process.

Sincerely,

 while some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voter as mention in the passage the Indefensible Electoral College by Bradford Plumer statistic show that a significant portion of the eligible population still exercise their right to vote voter participate in the election to express their political preference rather than with the expectation that their individual vote will determine the outcome this suggest that the Electoral College do not discourage engagement or interest in the electoral process 

 in conclusion the Electoral College play a fundamental role in our democratic system by ensure certainty of outcome foster a representative presidency encourage a well inform electorate provide a balance of power between state and avoid the complexity of run off election for these reason I implore you to support the preservation of the Electoral College it be essential for maintain a strong and inclusive democracy that represent the diverse interest and need of all american citizen 

 thank you for consider my perspective on this matter I trust that you will carefully weigh the benefit of the Electoral College and make an informed decision that uphold the principle of fairness and representation in our electoral process

516,1,"Many people across the country would believe that having an Electoral College is good idea. Well, I believe that it is not a good idea to continue having an Electoral College to chose our president because the people deserve to have their votes count. In the process of having an Electoral College the popular votes do not count, only the slate of electors can vote for the candidate. That's not even the worst part to begin with.

In source 2, it says that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. That is more than half the amount of voters in the country! It even states ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" meaning that sometimes the electors would not always have the same idea in mind as the people have. To me that is a real bummer especially for the people in the state with those kinds of electors.

Furthermore, the Electoral college may have a few benefits as it states in source 3. Fore example, it says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" meaning that barely anyone would vote in the state. But that is usually a rare occasion and is easily avoided in every state. As individuals we would usually not avoid coming to vote in an election for certain positions especially when it comes to a president.

Sometimes people would even let the Electoral College vote for them without the people knowing who they voted for. The Electoral College is supposed to represent their state towards a candidate but what if the state rarely has any electors to be represented or doesn't have any at all? That is why it is up to the people to make their own decision in who they want to vote for and hopefully their vote counts. The Electorial College may be recomended to represent their state but they can never represent every individual's vote because not all people have the same candidate in mind and the Electorial College can only vote for one candidate.

Overall, I think the Electoral College should be abolished in every way. It is the people's vote that should count not the electors. Some people may disagree but I still believe the Electorial College is not good for us. It is not truely fair to have the majority of popular votes on one candidate and still that candidate does not win due the Electoral College.

1448,1,"Subject: The Electoral College and the Debate on Presidential Elections

I am writing to share my thoughts on the ongoing discourse surrounding the Electoral College and the potential shift towards a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that a careful examination of both systems is necessary to make an informed decision about the future of our electoral process.

The Electoral College, established by the framers of the Constitution, has long been a pillar of our democratic system. One key advantage of this system is its ability to provide a fair representation of diverse interests across states. The allocation of electoral votes based on the number of congressional representatives and senators ensures that both populous and less populous states have a say in the election outcome. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated urban areas, promoting a more inclusive approach to governance.

Critics of the Electoral College often highlight its winner-takes-all nature in most states, which can lead to the neglect of minority voices within those states. Additionally, concerns arise when a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the electoral vote, raising questions about the system's fairness. While these criticisms are valid, it is essential to recognize that the Electoral College serves as a safeguard against the potential tyranny of the majority, ensuring that the interests of all states are considered in the election process.

Furthermore, proponents of the Electoral College argue that it prevents the concentration of power in a few populous states. Without this system, there is a risk that candidates may focus solely on major cities, disregarding the concerns and needs of citizens in less populated areas. The Electoral College encourages candidates to address a broad spectrum of issues that resonate with voters across diverse geographic and demographic backgrounds.

However, acknowledging the flaws of the current system is crucial. It is clear that there are valid concerns about minority voices being overshadowed and instances where the popular vote does not align with the electoral outcome. To address these issues, a careful and comprehensive reform effort is necessary. Rather than a binary choice between the Electoral College and a popular vote, exploring hybrid models or modifications to the existing system may offer a balanced solution.

In conclusion, the debate over the Electoral College and the potential shift to a popular vote system is complex and multifaceted. Both systems have their merits and drawbacks, and any decision should be made with a thorough understanding of the potential consequences. A thoughtful and inclusive approach to electoral reform is essential to preserving the integrity of our democratic process.

1461,1,"I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my perspective on a crucial aspect of our democratic systemвЂ”the method by which we elect the President of the United States. The current system, the Electoral College, has been a subject of debate and scrutiny, with some advocating for its retention while others call for a shift to a popular vote system. After carefully considering information from various sources, I am inclined to argue in favor of maintaining the Electoral College.

The Electoral College, as outlined in the Constitution, has been a cornerstone of our electoral process since the founding of our nation. One of the key advantages of this system is its ability to provide a voice to a broader range of states and prevent the dominance of a few populous states in determining the outcome of the presidential election. This aspect of the Electoral College ensures that candidates must appeal to a diverse array of states and their respective interests, fostering a more balanced and representative approach to campaigning.

Furthermore, the Electoral College acts as a stabilizing force, promoting a degree of certainty and predictability in our electoral outcomes. This system encourages candidates to build broad coalitions of support across states, rather than focusing solely on densely populated urban areas. In doing so, the Electoral College helps maintain the integrity of our federal system, ensuring that the President represents a diverse cross-section of the nation.

While some argue that the popular vote system would be more democratic, it is essential to address the potential shortcomings and counterclaims associated with such a shift. Critics of the Electoral College often highlight instances where a candidate can win the popular vote but lose the election. However, it's crucial to recognize that the Electoral College was designed to prevent the tyranny of the majority and protect the interests of smaller states.

In addition to the theoretical advantages, practical considerations also support the retention of the Electoral College. Implementing a popular vote system would require a significant overhaul of our electoral infrastructure, potentially leading to increased logistical challenges, higher costs, and a more complicated voting process.

In conclusion, while no system is without flaws, the Electoral College remains a vital component of our democratic process. It ensures a balanced representation of states, prevents the concentration of power in a few populous areas, and maintains the stability of our electoral outcomes.

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved for several important reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. As demonstrated in the 2000 election, a dispute over the popular vote can lead to prolonged legal battles and uncertainty. However, the electoral vote invariably exceeds the popular vote share of the winning candidate, reducing the likelihood of such disputes. This system provides stability and confidence in the electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president is representative of the entire country and not just certain regions. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must have trans-regional appeal. This is crucial for ensuring that the president can effectively govern all regions and address the concerns of diverse populations. Without the Electoral College, there is a risk of candidates appealing only to certain regions, which could lead to a lack of representation for others.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in each state encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that voters in swing states receive more attention from candidates and are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. These voters tend to be more thoughtful and informed, making them ideal decision-makers for the election. The Electoral College incentivizes candidates to engage with a broader range of voters and prioritize their concerns.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a balance of power between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, where each state has two senators regardless of population, already gives small states more weight in the political process. The Electoral College further enhances this balance by allotting electoral votes based on a state's population. This prevents large states from overpowering smaller states and helps ensure that the interests of both are considered.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections in the case where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This is particularly important in maintaining a clear winner and avoiding further complications in the election process. The Electoral College system has consistently produced a clear winner, preventing the need for additional rounds of voting and potential confusion.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections are typically those who want to express a political preference rather than those who believe their vote might decide the outcome. Additionally, the current system still encourages candidates to campaign in all states, even if some are considered safe for one party or the other.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system is crucial for maintaining a fair and effective method of electing the President of the United States. It ensures certainty of outcome, representation for all regions, targeted campaigning in swing states, balance between large and small states, and a clear winner without the need for run-off elections. I urge you to consider these points when evaluating any proposals to change the current system.

209,1,"Dear Senator, I heartily agree that we the people should keep the electoral College. Like you may already know, ""the ElectoralCcollege is a process, not a place."" Our founding fathers have made it, and as we look back into history, we realize that they were right about how a lot of things run in the U.S., so why should we question them now? Even we too as citizens know that they were right for making the Electoral College. As much as we aren't a citizen ruled society, we aren't a totalitarian society either.

A really good reason for having the Electoral College is simply recognized by saying that it kind of gives usthe citizens of America the ""power"" to vote for our president, rather than it being inherited, or voted upon solely by government officials, or some random process like in North Korea where Kim Jung Uun gets voted because he basically brainwashed his people into loving him. It gives us a certainty that we can chose the betterment for America. Also, though roughly half of the U.S. might agree, and the other half might disagree, you are entitled to your own opinion, and voting gives you the chance to show your opinion about whom you believe should be able to run our beautiful homeland as our trusted founding fathers once did, as president.

I'm sure that it has come to you that their are, in fact, several great reasons for allowing the Electoral college still run, but their is a couple of downsides. First off, the people within the Electoral College that vote for us citizens, don't vote for each individual person, they vote based upon who is voted the most in their relative area in whichever state their in, so the people don't all get their votes out. This could have turned several presidential elections around and helped the man or woman that lost in the election to win it.

After seeing the great pro's and the tiny con's, I'm sure your settled upon the opinion of holding on to the Electoral College,though you are entitled to your own opinion, you can't deny the facts.",0,"dear Senator I heartily agree that we the people should keep the electoral College like you may already know the ElectoralCcollege be a process not a place our found father have make it and as we look back into history we realize that they be right about how a lot of thing run in the U.S. so why should we question they now even we too as citizen know that they be right for make the Electoral College as much as we be n't a citizen rule society we be n't a totalitarian society either

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my position on the electoral process for electing the President of the United States. After careful consideration of the arguments and evidence, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College. While there are valid concerns regarding the Electoral College system, I believe it provides several practical benefits that would be lost if we were to switch to a popular vote system.

One of the main reasons for keeping the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues, a dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. Furthermore, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region, such as the South or the Northeast, has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Therefore, candidates are incentivized to campaign nationwide and appeal to voters from different regions. This is crucial for a successful presidency, as it prevents one region from feeling disenfranchised and ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the so-called swing states. These states play a pivotal role in deciding the election and therefore receive the most attention from candidates. This type of targeted campaigning encourages voters in these states to be more engaged and informed, as they know their votes will have a significant impact on the final outcome.

The Electoral College also provides a balance in representation between large and small states. As Bradford Plumer points out, large states like California, with a significant population, receive more attention from presidential candidates due to the greater number of electoral votes they possess. This ensures that candidates address the concerns and interests of both small and large states, thus maintaining a fair representation.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complication of run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Run-off elections can be time-consuming and expensive, and the Electoral College system guarantees a clear winner in each election. This stability in the electoral process allows for a smooth transition of power and avoids further political divisions and disputes caused by inconclusive outcomes.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, I believe the practical benefits it offers outweigh the potential disadvantages. The Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses campaigning efforts on swing states, balances representation between large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages contribute to a fair and effective election process that upholds the principles of the Founding Fathers.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope you will take my viewpoint into consideration when discussing any potential changes to the electoral process.

Also you can get so much more exercise from just walking to where you need to go than taking your car. It seems difficulty to live without your car but they show that some people can do it , so can you.

You just moved into your new home in Vauban , Germany. You have to pay money just to park your car. In the article ""In german suburb, life goes on without cars."" According to Elisabeth Rosenthal , it states in paragraph 2 that ""Car ownership is allowed , but there ar only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" So if you want to park your car , you have to pay just to keep it there and always pay for your house.

Think of all the people that have cars , take buses , basically anything with an engine is polluting our earth. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" according the writer , Robert Duffer it states in paragraph 10 that ""After days of nearrecord pollution , Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" They almost broke a record of so much pollution and the main reason of that is because of cars. So if you have less people driving them , the less polluted our world with be.

Instead of driving just everywhere , you can get exricse and move your body to the place you need to go. Not only is it healthy for your body and life , its healthy for our world. In the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" The author Andrew Selsky stated in paragraph 20 that ""In a program thats set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" They got where the needed to go , without their car. So just on that one day , they helped out our world and themselves.

In conclusion , having no car is just better for everyone. You get to save so much money on gas or not having to pay for a parking spot. Our world is not as polluted with all thr smoke and gas that cars cause. You get to get exercise for the day and feel better. If you can go a day with no car , you can live your life with no car. So help save the world and your wallet by not using a car.",0,"have a car can be very stressful and cost a lot of money not only do have a car hurt our earth but it hurt your wallet or you can hurt other people also you can get so much more exercise from just walk to where you need to go than take your car it seem difficulty to live without your car but they show that some people can do it so can you

319,1,"The Electoral College is a process in which electors pick the president instead of the people, but is it worth keeping. No, the Electoral College is not worth keeping because it reflects the view of the electors instead of the people.

Some people would argue that the Electoral college should be kept because it ensures the certainty of the outcome source 3 paragon 18. However this relies on a winner takes all system which makes the say of the minority voters pointless since even if they do vote then their vote is pointless. Second of all the presidents only campaign in states they are not sure of and completly ignore the states they know they will win source 3 paragraph 19. This may be a good strategy but if we instead abolished the Electoral College then everyones vote would matter and the candidate would have to campaign in every state to ensure his victory. In all the Electoral College should be abolished because it takes away say of the people.

Not only does the Electoral college take away the say of the people, it also has no protection against a tie of states that have an even number of electors source 2 paragraph 11. For instance a state like hawaii that has a total of two electors if they both vote for different people then how are the votes decided well it already happened in 1960,but Richard Nixon who was the vice president at the time and known to be against the Electoral College decided to only aknowledge his opponents electors. That is why we should abolish the Electoral College.

Allow me ask a hypothetical question what if the electors were corrupt and voted for whomever they pleased without even considering the peoples vote source 1 paragraph 2. We have no system to ensure that the people vote matters but the electors does therefore electors that are picked by former candidates may be more likely to return the favor and ignore the peoples vote and vote for their candidate. There are many important figures whom are against the Electoral College such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, and Bob Dale there are many more but thes are all politicians who see the Electoral College the same way the people do source 2 paragraph.

By limiting car use it can help us tramendisly but what you do to make that happen is key. As written, Studies show that americans are purchasing fewer cars, licenses, and also driving as more and more years go by. Some might have a different opinion or perspective and say that cars are their life and that is the only way they will function. While others see and appreciate the advantages of limiting car usage. Many things including Less traffic, less accidents , more safety , and better health come as positive outtakes for lessening automotive use. One thing surprisingly that is good for your health as a result of no cars is cycling. ""New yorks bike sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities"". I can see that just by leaving your car once a week at home and using a bike, You can get a workout , arrive at your destination quicker, and you might even get into the habit of leaving your car at home more often. So it does'nt hurt to try it once, Plus you can also save about thirty bucks which is fine by me and my wallet.

2090,1,"Dear Senator,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. Today, I write to you regarding the means of electing the President of the United States: the Electoral College. While the process has faced fierce criticism, I contend that it serves our nation well and should be preserved.

The Electoral College was crafted by our founding fathers as a compromise outlined in the Constitution (Office of the Federal Register), and this compromise is often overlooked in the fervor to shift towards a direct popular vote. The system may not proffer the impression of a modern democratic concept where every vote has the same weight; however, it is eminently practical in application. 

Judge Richard A. Posner elucidates five practical reasons for maintaining the Electoral College system. Each reason reflects the ingenious architecture of our nation's democratic process, expertly tailored to prevent potential chaos and disruption in our presidential elections. From the certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, to restoration of weight for big states and avoidance of run-off elections, the Electoral College serves to ensure that our Presidential elections run smoothly and that every state matters.

Surely, there can be unpredictable anomalies, as noted by Bradford Plumer, who cites examples from history where the popular vote winner did not win the presidency. There are instances of electors defying the will of the people or double submissions of electors. However, these instances have been rather infrequent, and safeguards are in place should they arise.

Plumer also argues that the Electoral College disincentivizes candidates from focusing their campaign efforts evenly across all states. While that can seem undemocratic, Posner points out that this incentivizes candidates to appeal broadly to multiple regions of the country. Furthermore, the system brings out the most thoughtful voters in the swing states, thereby ensuring that those who are vested in the political process play a crucial role in these elections. In addition, large-populated states still receive significant attention due to their potential electoral votes.

The Electoral College system ensures finality in our elections, preventing potentially contentious run-off situations that could reverberate with political turmoil. The popular vote system may seem like a more straightforward democratic process, but it lacks the fail-safes that the Electoral College provides, which our forefathers ingeniously crafted.

In conclusion, the Electoral College may seem antiquated; nevertheless, its relevance is timeless in protecting our democracy from the potential pitfalls of a strictly popular vote methodology. We need to uphold this process, educate our constituents about its value, and maintain the stability of our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Best Regards,

409,1,"The Electoral College is a process begun a long time ago due to the lack of educated and literate citizens in the United States, whom the government did not believe were eligible to vote for any president under any circumstances. Now that our literacy rate in the United states is now more than 8090% or so I believe, I don't really think that the Electoral College is useful anymore.

The Electoral College is a process describing 538 electors voted for by the state who will vote for the new president every four years. A majority vote of 270, one more than half, is required to elect the new president. The number of electors for each state equals the number of members in it's Congressional delegation meaning one for each member in the House of Representatives that represents your state, and two for your Senators. However, I think that a popular vote, or having the citizens themselves vote for the president, may be more useful.

There is an off chance that electors may vote for a candidate that their citizens did not want to choose, or the chance that two slates of electors may be sent to Congress, etc. Another prospect is the idea of a tie in the electoral vote, which would mean that there would be 269 votes for both Presidential candidates. In the event of this happening, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, in which the state delegations would choose the president. This may be fatal, however, because states like Wyoming, which only have the population of 500,000, will have as much to say about the fate of the United States as a state like California, home to 35 million people.

A lot of people usually are in favor of the Electoral College due to certainty of outcome and swing states. Swing, or tossup states are the states that are undecided until the very end, and could very well change the entire tide of the Election. ""Voters in tossup states,"" reads one argument, ""are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election."" But should we really leave such a large and important decision up to such few people? A mere 538? And even less for tossup states?

Overall, I think that the Electoral College is outdated due to it's lack of need anymore, does not fit the democratic and equal methods of the United States for the most part, and leaves too large of a decision to too small of a group. Popular voting may just be the solution to this problem, and although popular voting may not be perfect either, it might help us figure out who we really need for our president, rather than leaving it to just a small group.",0,"the Electoral College be a process begin a long time ago due to the lack of educate and literate citizen in the United States whom the government do not believe be eligible to vote for any president under any circumstance now that our literacy rate in the United state be now more than 8090 or so I believe I do n't really think that the Electoral College be useful anymore

1337,1,"Dear, senator I believe the electoral college was a useful tool in the past ,but is now an out date system that should be changed. If we continue to use this system we aren't really giving the people a fair chance to vote for who they want.

This raise another issue, which is not everybody is voting and it is not all a right but a prestige among US citizens every where. The electoral college was elective in the past because we did not have the technology to count all the votes from each state, but now we do so we can only go by the popular vote.

The popular vote is more effective and I'm not the only one who thinks so over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Al Gore thanks to the electoral college won the popular vot but lost the electoral, how is it that some one could win more votes from most voters ,but still lose? The answer is the electoral college, the reason is that you are not voting as a indiviual person but as a state. This brings me back to California and how republicans votes don't count because the state voted democrat.

Though the electors should do there job and vote with the state they could always defy the will of the people.

515,0,"Almost everyone owns a car because people are traveling constantly to get from point A to point B. No matter who it may be, that person at some point in their lives needs some way to get around. Everyday people need to either go to the store, pick up their kids, go to work, go to school, you name it. That doesn't mean that owning a car is a necessity, all around the world many people are trying to cut down and limit their car usage by having a whole lot of other options. There are buses, people can car pool, walk, skate, bike, and many more. People are coming to the conclusion that if we, as a whole, decide to start cutting down on our usage of cars it can benefit the way we live.

Lots of people actually don't mind not having a car just yet. Most teenagers do want to get their license and a car but there's so much other things they need to focus on. It really is not a priority for them because they have school, work, plus if they do need to get somewhere they can always take the bus and get a ride from a friend Source 4. In Germany, there is a city by the name of Vauban, that is known to be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life Source 1. vaughn's goal and idea, which is to cut down on cars for a better living, has made it'a way around the world, so that other states and countries can aspire to do the same and little by little we could have a world that is not so dependent on cars. The idea of using cars, for some, it causes them stress and they're always tense, not using a car makes them happier, as stated by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two Source 1. The stress aspect of this could be due to the fact that in the most recent years, the percentage of car crashes and accidents have gone up. Many people abhor the idea of using cars because they have been in an terrible accident themselves or someone close to them. Also, it can even just be all the traffic jams that occur during rush hour, which makes people late and accidents do happen. For example in Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to their designated location, to leave the streets due to traffic jams Source 3. Since they knew that lots of their citizens were deciding not to use cars they started making uneven, pitted sidewalks into nice, smooth, replaced ones for them Source 3.

Another reason why people want to limit their usage on cars is because of all the pollution cars create. Passenger cars are rsponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States Source 1. Not many people think about the effects of air pollution like smog, but it is a big deal. Since people don't think about it often, there is no way for the majority of us to try and find a solution to put into action to stop it or help it go down. In Paris, there was a partial driving ban to clear the air around the city Source 2. Paris' partial ban was their idea to try and make their city a better place. With the ban being enforced and put into play there were about 4,000 drivers fined Source 2. It turns out that since the driving ban was made the congestion, car traffic, had gone down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after five days of less smog pollution and Paris is typically known to have more smog than any other European capitals Source 2. This goes to show, that slowly people are actually becoming aware of what's going on and they actually care enought to try and make things better.

All in all, there are many ways to try and cut down on our car usage for the better. It can be anything from not buying as many cars, to deciding to not use cars at all and deciding to walk, skate, and bike, etc. Not only will limiting our car usage as a whole stop traffic jams, car accidents, air pollution, and more, it will help to benefit our lives for the better whether or not people want to believe it. If things keep going from here, and more and more decide that less car usage is better than over a time span of let's say 2030 years, there could be a lot less dangerous things occuring in our lives.",0,"almost everyone own a car because people be travel constantly to get from point a to point B. no matter who it may be that person at some point in their life need some way to get around everyday people need to either go to the store pick up their kid go to work go to school you name it that do n't mean that own a car be a necessity all around the world many people be try to cut down and limit their car usage by have a whole lot of other option there be bus people can car pool walk skate bike and many more People be come to the conclusion that if we as a whole decide to start cut down on our usage of car it can benefit the way we live

543,0,"All around the world, people are using gasgusling vehicles of mass destruction. Recently, Germany came up with the revolutionary idea to limit the use cars by forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages in the new, experimental district of Vauban. Others have joined the bandwagon as well, instituting new laws, such as the ""CarFree Day"" in Bogota, Colombia, and the partialdriving ban in Paris, France. France, Germany, and Colombia are the predeccessing countries to the innovational car usage limitations. These limitations have many advantages, such as a decrease in pollution, traffic, and a longterm positive culture shift.

Pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases is one of the common issues troubling countries worldwide. A limit of the use of cars and other various vehicles that run of fossil fuels has been proven to help counter the depletion of Earth's Ozone layer. According to Source 2: Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog, ""The Smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world... Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" The city of Paris had legislate, ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day"" . Resulting from their legislation, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday"" . Paris, originally one of the worlds' mostpolluted cities, decreased their pollution so much in one day that it was deemed unnecessary to continue the ban for the oddnumbered license plates the next day. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Article 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars . A decrease in these emissions could have significant effects, as witnessed in Paris. Also, a Local Colombian businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza claimed that the CarFree Day was ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" Source 3: CarFree Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota . The government and their factions are in agreement that the ban on cars is only positive. Whether it is Colombia, Germany, or Paris, the restriction on drving was a major success. Imagine if more countries around the world opted to institute this ban there would be no energycrisis nor would there be as much of a pollution issue.

Along with the decrease in pollution, there would be a massive decrease in traffic. The vehicular limitations in the betacountries France, Colombia, and Germany have shown that the restrictions imposed decrease the amount of traffic significantly. Based on Source 3 , in Bogota, ""... a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Rather than having a holierthanthou complex, these Colombians supported the greater good of their country and ceased use of all cars on the carfree day. A positive domino affect occured in Colombia as well. According to Source 3 , ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" These beta countries have improved the standard of living by meerely putting some restrictions on driving for brief periods of time. The United States has seen various changes as well. While there are no current driving restrictions, new priorities are being discovered, such as the bikesharing program in one of America's most heavily trafficed cities, New York. According to Source 4: The End of Car Culture , ""New York's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a poliferation of carsharinf programs across the nation."" Nations are beginning to catch on to the contagious cold of revolutionary alternatives to driving and traffic crises.

France, Germany, Colombia, and the United States are already seeing positive changes. The longterm culture shift is proving to be an aspiration for many countries. According to Source 4 , ""The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of city centers has made the suburbs less appealing and has crawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" People are becoming more connected through digital devices as societies become more technologically advanced, therefore the need for a large amount of privately owned cars has become moot. In Vauban, Germany, Heidran Walter, a media trainer and mother, claims, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" . Commoners, such as Mrs. Walter, are respoding positively to the laws of the experimental district of Vauban, which has very few areas and opportunities for cars. In fact, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"" . This modernday industrial revolution is drawing vast numbers of people into the areas inwhich cars have become a rarity.

Source 1 also states that ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning""."" The beta countries have had much success and have not seen failure yet. Although in France, ""Almost 4,000 dricers were fined... Twentyseven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"" , it should not be considered a failed experiment. Of the millions of people who live in France, they only saw a small fraction of driving infractions on the day they limited driving. The longterm culture shift that the world is beginning to see is certainly moving in a positive direction.

Between ISIS and the iPhone, the world has come across a variety of both positive and negative circumstances. Considering all of the positive effects of limitations of cars, including but not limited to less traffic, a decrease in pollution, and longterm culture shifts, there have been many advantages to the switch to a carfree enviornment. Even though transportation may take longer, it will be safer and better for the enviornment. Not everyone country can guarantee that all of their citizens will abide by the new laws, as shown in France, but a small fraction of the trouble is better than the mass population of millions, and in some places billions, wrecking havoc on the planet.",0,"all around the world people be use gasgusle vehicle of mass destruction recently Germany come up with the revolutionary idea to limit the use car by forbid street parking driveway and home garage in the new experimental district of Vauban other have join the bandwagon as well institute new law such as the CarFree Day in Bogota Colombia and the partialdrive ban in Paris France France Germany and Colombia be the predeccesse country to the innovational car usage limitation these limitation have many advantage such as a decrease in pollution traffic and a longterm positive culture shift

1515,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Car usage has long been associated with middle-class suburban life, but recent trends and initiatives are challenging this notion. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage. By adopting smart planning techniques, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, these communities are not only contributing to environmental sustainability but also improving the quality of life for their residents.

Body Paragraph 1:
One of the advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the articles, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By implementing car-free zones, like the ones in Vauban and Paris, these communities are actively combating air pollution. The success of these measures is evident in the significant decrease in congestion and smog levels. For example, Paris experienced a 60 percent reduction in congestion after enforcing a driving ban due to smog.

Body Paragraph 2:
Another benefit of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation. Vauban, for instance, has embraced a low-car suburban lifestyle, where 70 percent of families do not own cars. Residents of this community rely on public transportation and bicycles to commute, which not only reduces their carbon footprint but also improves their overall well-being. Car-free days, like the one in Bogota, are becoming more popular worldwide, encouraging millions of people to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work instead of driving. These events play a crucial role in shifting people's behavior towards more sustainable transportation options.

Body Paragraph 3:
In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to the creation of more compact and accessible communities. By placing stores within walking distance and reducing space for parking, suburbs can become less dependent on cars. This approach not only reduces traffic congestion and allows for a more efficient use of space but also fosters a sense of community. In Vauban, the absence of cars has resulted in verdant streets where people can freely walk and children can play without the constant noise and pollution associated with vehicular traffic.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly apparent in various communities worldwide. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of alternative transportation, and creation of more compact and accessible neighborhoods are all contributing to a more sustainable and fulfilling way of life. As more people embrace these initiatives, the car culture that has dominated suburban areas for decades may soon be a thing of the past. By prioritizing the environment and prioritizing the community, we can create a future that is not dependent on cars and is focused on the well-being of its residents.",1,"title the advantage of limit car usage

877,1,"The dispute over keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has been going on for awhile.

128,0,"The usage of motor vehicles has been on a steady decline for the last several years. More and more people are relying on carpooling and other means of transportation. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's articles, she discusses Vauban, Germany, where cars are forbidden and how the use of cars has been on the decline. In Robert buffer's article, he talks about Paris' issues with pollution and the ways it has been dealt with. In Andrew Selsky's article, he talks about a program in Colombia when citizens use other means of transportation other than cars. The perks of limiting car usage include less pollution, less traffic congestion, and improved safety.

The main culprit of pollution issues is car usage. In Source 2, Robert Duffer says that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France...""Duffer 16 This is because of a tax policy that has a preference to this fuel. Diesel fuel is a lot more harmful than regular gasoline, and if many people are using this fuel pollution rates will skyrocket. Cutting down on these fuels altogether could create a less polluted environment. In addition, cars cause 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50 percent in specific places in the U.SRosenthal 5. This statistic is startling, since half of the pollution problems in the U.S are associated to cars. By using other means of transportation such as the train or even carpooling, this number can be greatly reduced to a much smaller percentage.

With more cars, more traffic congestion occurs. A sign of this congestion is evident when Rosenthal says""New York's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities.Rosenthal 37"" A lot of people are still using their own vehicles to get from point A to B, and as a result their is more money that has been given to toll bridges because of that. The encouragement of governments to suggest carpooling services and shared rides will decrease the revenue that comes from tolls. If everybody shared a ride with a person from work or from somewhere else, there would be a great decrease in traffic congestion.

Furthermore, public transportation such as the BART in the San Francisco Bay area has decreased the amount of drivers on the road. Although the rides are typically longer than driving a car from point A to B, it is a more efficient method of transportation.Rosenthal 40 Using these alternate methods of transportation decreases the amount of cars on the road at once. With less cars on the road at once, there is more efficiency in getting where you need to go.

Safety is one of the most important aspects of reducing the amount of cars. In Colombia, a program promotes the use of no cars one day per year. Many of the citizens use alternate methods of transportation such as walking and riding bikes.Selsky 20By promoting this, there are obviously less cars on the road and a lesser risk of people being injured by cars. With programs that promote other modes of transportation, many lives can be saved since there would be fewer cars on the road. Although many people require cars to get from place to place, the idea of lives being saved is something that shouldn't be ignored. Also, technology has aided the decline in cars. Telecommunication has helped people become connected to friends and family in a way without meeting with them face to face.Rosenthal 35 Because of this, people dont have to travel to meet with their friends and family. This has created a domino effect people can communicate through social media and texting which causes less cars to be on the road to visit other people and overall causes less safety isssues.

In conclusion, cars are the focal point of many issues in our society. They cause many safety issues such as traffic accidents,more traffic congestion which causes increases in revenue in tolls, and pollution issues. By reducing car usage, many of these problems can disappear, and can create a safer and healthier environment.",0,"the usage of motor vehicle have be on a steady decline for the last several year More and more people be rely on carpoole and other mean of transportation in Elisabeth Rosenthal 's article she discuss Vauban Germany where car be forbid and how the use of car have be on the decline in Robert buffer 's article he talk about Paris issue with pollution and the way it have be deal with in Andrew Selsky 's article he talk about a program in Colombia when citizen use other mean of transportation other than car the perk of limit car usage include less pollution less traffic congestion and improve safety

1428,1,"I am writing to share my perspective on the ongoing discourse surrounding the method for electing the President of the United States, specifically the debate between retaining the Electoral College system or transitioning to a popular vote. As a concerned citizen, I believe that a nuanced examination of the merits and drawbacks of both approaches is crucial for ensuring the continued strength and fairness of our democratic processes.

The Electoral College, as articulated in the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) documents, was designed by the framers as a compromise to balance the interests of large and small states in the presidential election process. This federalist approach reflects the core values of our nation, acknowledging the sovereignty of individual states while fostering national unity. By providing each state with electoral votes based on their representation in Congress, the Electoral College seeks to prevent the disproportionate influence of densely populated regions, ensuring a more equitable distribution of political power.

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it may lead to situations where a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the electoral vote, creating a perceived disconnect between the will of the people and the election outcome. The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) outlines various reform proposals, including the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC), which aims to align the electoral outcome with the national popular vote. While this proposal addresses concerns about the popular vote's alignment with the electoral result, it raises questions about the potential legal and constitutional implications, as well as the impact on states that choose not to participate.

It is important to acknowledge these counterarguments while also considering the potential consequences of transitioning to a popular vote system. The Electoral College, despite its criticisms, ensures that candidates must appeal to a broad spectrum of states, preventing them from focusing solely on high-population urban areas. This serves as a safeguard against the neglect of the concerns and needs of less populous states.

In conclusion, while the debate over the Electoral College system continues, I advocate for a thoughtful and measured consideration of its strengths and weaknesses. The system, rooted in the principles of federalism, prevents the concentration of political power and fosters a more inclusive representation of states in the presidential election process. Any proposed changes, such as the NPVIC, should be approached with careful consideration of their potential ramifications on the democratic integrity of our nation.

1105,0,"The usage of cars has really changed the way our world works. These expensive vehicles are what make make our world what it is and people take advantage of it. With cars we get to places faster than on a bike or even walking. Many people forget how cars work though. It takes up about 2,000 dollars a month depending on which car they have on gas and maintenance. The advantages of limiting car usage is reducing the amount of fuel the we use, we would save thousands of dollars, and become more green in the world. People prefer walking or biking to school or on their way home.

Driving starts at the age of 15. Imagine all the work parents do to drive their kids to school, then to work, and then pick up their kids from after school. Its crazy how much of gas an adult would be using every single day. Ofcourse picking up their kids from school is a guarantee but their are many other solutions to these type of things. If we started to use less fuel it would bring our economy out of debt. In the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""The End of car culture"" states that Americans have not been buying cars as often and driving less and fewer license being given over the years. The era of cars and driving could be coming to an end and creating a new way of getting to places. People would say that taking the bus might become the new strategy but who knows what the future holds for America, by the year 2030 we will be flying in cars or transportation to get to where we need to be. Transportation is the second largest source in America and vehicles are becoming something much different.

In New York a bikesharing program has started due to all the traffic and crowded streets their are people just take the subway and get to places faster than a car. Things like that save so much money. A change in the world would be very dramatic since everyone is so used to driving a car and getting to where they need to be. Studies shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal that even kids who live in urban areas that are 1921 do not have license and are perfectly happy with out having one. With the amount of money people can save in motorvehicles is ridiculous. The money they save can be used for many other important things in life like food and house spending all those things can get someone stressed could be fixed just by reducing the use of cars. Who says walking or biking isn't good for the soul.

Technology has really changed our lives and made our generation of children a new perspective that other never saw. As a teenager we are so dependant on many thingas and get addicted very fast to whatever comes at us. A day with out a car is like a day with out a phone. We wouldnt be able to particapat in anything. A car will take us where we want to go. Unlike in those movies where all the kids just bike to places, it seems more fun and interesting in that way. With all the money being spent we could be more green in the world as well. Everything is so manufactured in the world that people wonder why our economy is awful. Being eco friendly is the best way to go if everyone particiaptes in the cause. The world would honestly be such a better place if we all particapated in making it better.

Causes and actions have consequences in our world. The usage of cxars are very dependant on people and if we made a change people will be happier in life because they'll have more to recieve. Our world can become a much better place where people won't have to suffer with money because due to cars we pay alot of money that doesnt have to be spent.

987,1,"The Electoral Collage has been around for a long time. Every few years, voters go to vote on election day and their vote can either mean everything or nothing. There are many flaws with the Electoral Collage: it serves an outdated purpose, popular vote does not matter, and there is the possibility of the disaster factor. Using the Electoral Collage could lead to undesired consequences.

Back in the times in which the Electoral Collage was founded, commutation between the colonies was not quick. News could take months to arrive, and with the Electoral Collage, if news about a presidential candidate came out that made him a threat, for example if he was a murderer, the electors would know that and, despite what the voters thought, not to vote for him. In the current times, as soon as something had happened that would make a candidate look bad, it would not be very long before such news would be on T.V., social media Facebook, Twitter, etc.,and on the radio. So unless someone wasn't paying much attention, every vote should be valid.

With the Electoral Collage system, the vote of an individual does not matter. Whether three people in a state vote or threemillion vote, as long as a majority only 51% of the votes vote for the candidate, that candidate gets all the electoral votes for that state. If only 51% of people vote for a candidate he wins that state, that leaves 49% of people in that state whose votes are now discredited. Eventually, like in some cases such as the election in 2000, it can add up that a candidate wins the popular vote, the actual majority, but not the election. So despite the wishes of the majority, the other candidate in this situation would win.

When a candidate wins all the electoral votes for a state, those votes are sent to electors so that they can vote on behalf of the people, or not. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy.""""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer Not only an incident such as this could occur, but electors of two slates could be sent to congress and chose not to vote as asked. With all these flaws, why are we still using the Electoral Collage?

The Electoral Collage no longer serves the purpose it once did, and it is now doing more harm than good. Back when it was established, it did what was needed for the time. This is a new era, it's time for a new system.",0,"the Electoral Collage have be around for a long time every few year voter go to vote on election day and their vote can either mean everything or nothing there be many flaw with the Electoral Collage it serve an outdated purpose popular vote do not matter and there be the possibility of the disaster factor use the Electoral Collage could lead to undesired consequence

13,1,"dear senator, I have come to a conclusion on how I think the president and his candidates should be voted for. In one hand we've got the Electoral College, and the election by popular vote. These two thing have been around for hundreds of years but you've got to know if you prefer one or the other. So which one works better? Why do you prefer this one over the other?

The Electoral College, electors meeting and voting for our president and vice president. This electoral college consist of 538 electors that vote to for our president. I myself dont think this is a very sensible thing. Because when you think you're voting for the president you are actually voting for a state of electors who will in turn vote for the president not you. Why should there be a select few people out of the billions of people who live in america to vote for the president while we just sit and wait for the results. To only have their opinions voiced. Does'nt seem like a very fair way to elect someone who will be changing our country. This is a winnertakeallsystem.

Election by popular vote, this means you and I will be voting for the president and his cabinet ourselves. That we will have a say in who we want to change or even fix our country. Although the person we vote for may not win, we still got a say in what we believe would have made our country a better place. Although the Electoral College might give a more clear winner, if we know that our vote will actually have an effect in the election we might pay more attention to the election and vote more wisely. Knowing that we have voiced our preference rather than knowing maybe one single electoral vote might have set the election.

Now there are some benefits if the Electoral College. In the case of having a precise vote on who gets to be president is one. Also maybe the fact that you voted fo the people who will be electing the president in a way is just the same. However this does notmean that it is better than you just voting yourself. Because those are onlyabout the two thing that are evn remotely good about the Electoral College.

So when you decide who you want to be president think of how you would like your vote to be heard. through your own vote or maybepossibly through anothers vote. I know which system i would choose. Giving that it would give me more voicein the matter.",0,"dear senator I have come to a conclusion on how I think the president and his candidate should be vote for in one hand we have get the Electoral College and the election by popular vote these two thing have be around for hundred of year but you have get to know if you prefer one or the other so which one work well why do you prefer this one over the other

894,1,"Dear Senator, I want to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States because it is easier and makes a lot more sense. When you vote by the Electoral College, you are actually voting for your candidates electors. When you vote for the electors, it doesn't necessarily mean they will vote for their candidate. Voters can't always control who their electors vote for, as stated in ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" There is a single argument against the Electoral College is best known as the disaster factor. In 1960, segregationists who were in the Louisiana Legislature succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy. They did this so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. In almost the same way, ""faithless"" electors sometimes refuse to vote for their party's candidate. Instead they cast a deciding vote for whoever they want.

The electors and segregationists in the Electoral College think they can do whatever they please. They make decisions that wouldn't be fair to the voters or the candidates. If the voter votes for a certain candidate but the elector votes for a different candidate, this could cause trouble and madness within the election. The Electoral College is not always fair. However, if we switch to the election of the popular votes, the election would be fair. The candidates would be chosen based on the number of votes they got from voters, not by who the electors want to vote for.

People also worry about the prospect of a tie in the Electoral College. If this happens, the election would be handed over to the House of Representatives. Then the state delegations would vote on the president. In this case, the Senate would choose the vicepresident.""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative in Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". From this context, we can say that the House's selection can barely be expected to reflect the will of the people.

I think the Electoral College is not accurate and the electors in it are not very fair. If someone elects a certain candidate, but the elector votes for someone else, there really isn't a purpose for people to vote. If people don't vote, then our country won't have a president. The Electoral College can take this country downhill in several ways. We should let the people decide who they want to run their country. That way, the voting will be more fair, easier, and not as many bad things could happen while the process of voting is going on.

Subject: Support for the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system as the method of choosing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked.

First and foremost, the Electoral College system ensures certainty of outcome. In the event of a disputed election, the system provides a clear path for resolution. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College vote almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote, thereby minimizing the risk of prolonged legal battles and uncertainty. This was particularly evident in the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and his opponent. 

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes a candidate with trans-regional appeal. No particular region of the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means candidates must appeal to a broad range of voters across the nation. This ensures that the president represents the interests of all Americans, rather than just those in certain geographic regions. Without the Electoral College, candidates may be tempted to focus solely on densely populated areas, neglecting the concerns of less populated regions.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its impact on swing states. Under this system, candidates are compelled to campaign vigorously in these states, knowing that they hold the key to victory. This leads to greater engagement and attention from voters, creating an electoral process where the most thoughtful and informed voters have the greatest impact. By contrast, a popular vote system would encourage candidates to spend their time and resources in just a handful of heavily populated states, disregarding the concerns of other regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College gives a fair representation to states with smaller populations. The electoral vote allocation reflects the mal-apportionment of the Senate, providing some balance to the political influence of smaller states. This ensures that these states are not overshadowed by larger states during presidential campaigns, giving them the opportunity to have their concerns and interests heard.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College reliably produces a clear winner. This prevents the complexities and uncertainties associated with run-off elections, allowing a smooth transition of power and certainty in the outcome.

While some critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states that are considered safe or stronghold for a particular party, the high voter turnout in recent elections indicates that voters still feel motivated to cast their vote, irrespective of the electoral outcome of their state. 

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides certainty, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, fair representation for smaller states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These benefits are crucial to maintaining a stable and balanced democracy in the United States. For these reasons, I respectfully urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust you will consider the arguments I have presented and make the best decision in the interest of our great nation.

The thing these countries have decided to change in their everyday life is to take cars away or start limiting the use of them. Now this might sound like a big deal but their are many advantages to this appeal of motor use.

Some advantages of cars being limited or just not used at all, would mean we would be saving more money. Just think about all the money you throw away to put it towards your car. Their are bills, repairs, new car if you get into a bad accident, ect. The list just goes on and on. Their could be so much more you could spend your money on and it could make are economy richer.

In source 3: carfree day is sprinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky it states that "" In Bogota people who violated the car usage would be faced witha fine of 25"". This is another way of showing you how much money you are wasting on your car.

Another advantage to not owning or using a car would be the pollution levels in the earths atmosphere would go down. In sourse 2:paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer it states that ""after days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a parital driving ban to clean the air of the global city"". Now the people of the world should have never let pollutin get this bad. The french more of paris had smog a type of pollution for at least a week. In source 4: the end of the car culture by Elizabeth Rosenthal it states that ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was on January 1995"". So the cars limitations is actually helping lower the number of miles which means the pollution rate is also going down.

Their are many advantages to not using or at least limiting the use of a car. such as reducing the money that is spent on one which wouls help the economy out. Also reducing the the pollution that cars produce.

1045,0,"In today's growing world to many it may seem as if living without a car would be impossible. Our ever evolving lifestyles and cultures though may prove otherwise. Across the globe it is becoming more likely for people to leave their car at home, and walk opposed to driving a short commit. The benefits of this decision are incredibly impactful on the environment, improving human health and safety, as well as on our, the people's bank accounts. Becoming a society nonrelient on cars will prove not to be easy, but justifiable when those three points are taken into account.

Thus proving drastic measures need to be taken to secure our planet's future. What better way of doing so then by reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere. Source one line five states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" The article goes on to state in line seven our lives being centered around the use of cars will have to change. Our planet needs it's inhibitors to treat it with the same respect people do to the dignified, and a car free world is one way to do so.

By decreasing the number of people using cars as their mode of transportation good health and safety will soon be boosted across the globe. The effect of walking instead of drving will decrease obesity and increase positive moods. According to source one line 3 Heidrun Walter believes she is much happier and less tense without a car. If she a working women and mother of two can live without a car I find many other people could find ways to also. Limiting the use of cars would not only improve health but safety. By limiting cars you limit the amount of possible accidents. Whether an accident results from carelessness, accident, or intoxication there is no arguing the fact they take many innocent lives daily. By reducing the amount of car usage this will no longer be a major factor in the premature deaths of people. According to all four sources the idea of leaving cars parked in the garage at home, or choosing to live a car free lifestyle is catching on now more than ever. Personally I hope we soon have healthier, safer pedestrians.

In today's economy money is tight. People looking to save a dollar will justify almost all reasoning to do so. Throughout the world many countries have decided to become less relient on cars. By making cities more compact people are finding it very possible to live a life without cars. Imagine cutting the price of not only a car, but car insurance and gas out of your life. I can promise you your wallet would thank you. Source four line 35 states ""We are witnessing a long term culture shift."" The internet has made it possible to connect with friends and family without meeting face to face and because of this the use of cars is rapidly declining. Source four also states many of America's youth are declining the possiblity to be licesnced and drive. Suprisingly enough Mr. Sivak, a socialogist's children do not drive their ages being in the early twenties. This is yet more proof of our ever evolving lifestyles.

Fellow citizens, at times our lives can deal us many unexpected difficulties that make living in this day and age problematic. Cutting out the use of cars however would not be one of them. Deciding against the use of cars would impactful the environment, improve human health and safety, and our bank accounts from draining.

2114,1,"Dear Senator,

I write to you as a concerned citizen and student, to express my views and concerns regarding our current method of electing the President of the United States, the Electoral College. After a careful study of various texts on the subject, I feel obligated to voice my argument against the Electoral College system. I propose that we adopt a new system based on pure popular vote to elect our country's President.

The Electoral College, undoubtedly part of our foundational history, was created as a compromise between a direct popular election and a congressional vote. Today, however, it appears to have outgrown its relevance and morphed into an undemocratic system. Bradford Plumer offers compelling arguments in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" pointing out how the Electoral College creates potential for disastrous results like “faithless” electors subverting the will of the people or that of an electoral vote tie leading to the House of Representatives determining the President.

Additionally, Plumer emphasizes how this system fosters unfairness against voters. For instance, the focus of candidates on swing states to maximize electoral votes often results in many states being overlooked entirely during campaign periods. Voters should hold equal importance regardless of where they live, and currently, the Electoral College diminishes this equality.

However, it is essential that we consider a counterargument provided by Judge Richard A. Posner. His reasons in favor of the Electoral College include certainty of outcome, increased candidates' trans-regional appeal, enhanced importance of swing states, balanced importance of big states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. Despite these seemingly valid points, I would argue that we must prioritize the principle of ""one person, one vote"".

I do not dismiss Posner's practical reasoning lightly but believe that the modern United States, a country that champions democracy globally, should base its elections on the most basic democratic principle: the majority rules. The fact that theoretically, a presidential candidate could win the popular vote yet fail to gain presidency due to the electoral college is a flaw that undermines this principle.

In sum, while the Electoral College may once have served a vital purpose, it is clear that its inherent flaws jeopardize the democratic value it initially sought to protect. Therefore, in light of these realities, it is our duty as defenders of democracy to promote change, ensuring every vote counts equally and that the popular vote determines the Presidential election outcome.

Thank you for your attention to this crucial matter. Our country's commitment to democratic principles depends on our collective actions, and I respectfully urge you, Senator, to consider my perspective.

1283,1,"Mr. Senator election by popular votee is the way to go, let the people decide! It's their choice to pick who runs the U.S.A. this is the choice of who they want to run the country. The citizens should have a right to votee for who they really want. Instead of having a couple hundred people I think we should have all the people in the country choose. So why dont we? We can establish this rule and make it right let the citizens of the U.S.A. pick who the president should be!

Electoral collage as the office of Federal Register in quote ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting og the electors where they votee for the President and Vice President"". It's a bad idea to me when you can just make everyone votee for who they want not who just a couple hundred people want. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors which a certain amount need to votee as 270 is the precise number is required. Each candidate running each has a group of electors, they are originally chosen by the candidates politicial party. The choice where the people choose and votee is way easier than that, we have a choice for what we want.

The ""Indefensible Electoral College"" is wrong your voteing for the electors as it says in paragraph 10. Bradford Plumer says as I quote ""Under the electoral college system voteers votee not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. There for we are voteing for the electors right? So whats the whole point when we can stick to our ways and vote ourselves. This makes it way more simple and faster, better than waiting through the system for other people to votee, when you can just do it yourself.

Theres no reason for each party to select a slate of electors. It can be argued that this system can turn off potential voteers as a candidate. There are 5 reasons for retaining this system. Those are certainty of outcome, everyone's President, swing States, Big states, and avoid runoff elections. Still we need to be able to make our own decisions. We don't need other people to make them for us.

These people in the U.S.A. are determined in what they want, not what other people want. They want to choose what they believe they don't want to go through a long system. When you can just do it yourself its easier, because you know what your doing but if you go the other way you have to teach the people your working with. When you have the whole Country voteing it makes it more simple and easy to go through the process.

1508,0,"Limiting car usage has many advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. Additionally, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and efficient transportation options, such as public transportation and cycling. Finally, reducing car dependence can lead to healthier and more active lifestyles for individuals. These advantages make it clear that limiting car usage is a positive step towards a more sustainable and livable future.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, and by decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint. The passage set states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make progress towards achieving greenhouse gas reduction goals and mitigating the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. Cars emit pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can have detrimental effects on human health. The passage set mentions that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and improved air quality. By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for ourselves and future generations.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and efficient transportation options. The passage set describes an experimental community in Germany called Vauban, where car ownership is limited and public transportation and cycling are prioritized. Similarly, the passage set mentions a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, which aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. By investing in public transportation infrastructure and prioritizing walking, cycling, and public transit, we can create more accessible and sustainable cities that are less dependent on cars.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to healthier and more active lifestyles for individuals. The passage set mentions that some residents of Vauban, Germany, feel happier and less stressed without cars. By reducing car usage, people are encouraged to walk or cycle more, leading to increased physical activity and improved health. Additionally, by investing in walkable neighborhoods and improving pedestrian infrastructure, we can create environments that are conducive to active lifestyles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, promote sustainable transportation options, and encourage healthier and more active lifestyles. By prioritizing alternatives to cars and investing in sustainable transportation infrastructure, we can create more livable and environmentally friendly cities. The benefits of limiting car usage make it clear that it is a necessary step towards a more sustainable and prosperous future.",1,"limit car usage have many advantage for both individual and the environment by reduce the number of car on the road we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emission and improve air quality additionally limit car usage can promote more sustainable and efficient transportation option such as public transportation and cycling finally reduce car dependence can lead to healthy and more active lifestyle for individual these advantage make it clear that limit car usage be a positive step towards a more sustainable and livable future

394,1,"The Electoral College is a system of appointing electors. These electors vote upon who will be the next president. Citizensvoters believe that they should be the ones able to decide who will become the president. People claim that this system should be changed to the ""popular vote"" system. This system is based on the people's votes. Even the smallest of states get their say in who will take the presidency. This form of electing should be put into play. The Electoral College should be abolished. It is interfering with citizen's rights. It is irrational, and should be changed.

Untrustworthy is a word used to describe the Electoral College. It can not be trusted. In some cases, the college is said to have chosen a candidate based upon themselves, not their state. An example of this appears in the election of 2000. In this election, 17 states were said to have never even seen the candidates. Voters said that they didn't even see campaign ads. This could have been caused by the college. The Electoral College is unjust.

A new case appears on 1960. In this case, Louisiana tried to recieve new electors who would go against J.F.K. Their electors weren't going with their beliefs. This is just one example of the injustice. Voters everywhere feel the college is unfair. They would like to have a greater role in the outcome of elections. They wish to feel more a part of this country.

Others say that the Electoral College should stay. They believe in five reasons for the acceptance of the system. One reason is the ""certainty of outcome."" The second reason is ""everyone's president."" This is saying that the college needs a presidential candidate to have appeal. This means that candidates need to not only campaign in popular states. Doing this makes the other states feel discouraged and feel as if their votes are not important. The next reason is due to the swing states. This is saying that they need to focus their campaigning on small, ""tossup"" states. Next reasoning is due to big states. They say the college restores and manages political balance. The last reasoning is that the college avoids when no candidate gets a greater amount of votes. This is saying that the college is able to break any ties between candidates.

Despite the reasonings given by the opposing side, the college causes problems. It is limiting voters' freedoms and rights. The voters want to be a part. They want to help their country. They want to be there to partake in the election and to choose their president fairly. The college is unjust and confusing. With the college, you do not know if you are getting the candidate that your state had voted for. The accuracy of your vote could be questioned. For these reasons and more are why we should change the system. We should remove the Electoral College system and replace it with the ""popular vote"" system. With this change we are ensuring the accuarcy to our voters. They will be able to take full part in the electoral election process.

2083,1,"Dear Senator [Name],

I am writing to share my concerns regarding the current method of electing our nation's president: the Electoral College. While the system holds historical value, echoing the time of the founding fathers, it also has severe repercussions. Therefore, I'm advocating a shift towards a direct popular vote system, a change necessary for preserving the democratic principles America prides itself on.

The Electoral College system, as defined by the Office of the Federal Register, establishes a process where we, the citizens, are actually voting for electors who subsequently cast their votes for the presidential candidates. The system carries undeniable flaws, counter to offering a fair representation of the populace's preference.

Bradford Plumer, in ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" highlights these issues in detail. He exposes the 'disaster factor', the potential for electors to defy their obligation towards citizens and manipulate the electoral process. Historical evidence supports this argument, with attempts to override popular vote dating back to 1960. Furthermore, under the current system, the overall will of the nation sometimes remains unaddressed, as exemplified when a president-elect receives fewer popular votes than their competitor – as occurred in the 2000 election when Al Gore lost to George Bush.

In addition, the winner-take-all rule, in battleground states, results in undue influence for a minority of citizens and discourages candidates from campaigning in states that they perceive as secure or unattainable. This creates a political landscape where many American votes play little part in the eventual election outcome.

However, those advocating for the retention of the Electoral College, Judge Richard A. Posner among them, argue that it provides certainty of outcome, ensures a candidate with trans-regional appeal, focuses attention on swing states with thoughtful voters, lends weight to larger states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While Posner's arguments carry weight, it is pertinent to ask ourselves if preserving a system that can discount the will of the majority for these benefits aligns with our core democratic values.

The Electoral College compromises the innate fairness and equality embedded in each vote. Democracy, in its purest sense, calls for an election system where every vote holds equal value, regardless of demographic or geographic factors. This fundamental democratic principle aligns more harmoniously with a direct popular vote system, where our citizens' collective voice can resonate unabridged.

I urge you, Senator [Name], to consider this plea from a concerned citizen. Promote a renewed conversation about our electoral system, questioning whether the Electoral College is the most suitable system for the 21st century. Emphasize the value of each vote, the crux of democracy, and America's timeless dedication to equality and representation.

346,0,"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Decreasing the amount of time citizens use personal motorvehicles positively impacts the environment and the state of mind of people. The lack of driving personal cars is becoming more widely accepted in several countries for different reasons. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, is an experimental district testing the lifestyle that does not use cars. Paris banned driving for environmental reasons, and Bogota decided to try it out too. Also, it is a trend in America for the purpose of saving money and because there are other convenient options.

The decrease in fumes from cars is very beneficial to the environment. People and organizations are making drastic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. According to paragraph five of ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" twelve percent of greenhouse gas in Europe is caused by passenger cars and fifty percent in some areas of the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities because emissions from cars contributes to half of the pollution in America. In the Article by Robert Duffer, ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"" he describes the event that Paris had to declare a ban on half of the drivers because the large amount of smog that lingered over Paris. Colombia even has a day dedicated to being free of cars to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. All of these events show the severity of environmental problems caused by cars and people making efforts to promote a better environment.

Also, a decrease in personal motor vehicles causes people to have a better state of mind. Heidrun Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" With a car comes a lot of responsibility which leads to a lot of stress on a person. Not having a car is one less bill to pay and thing to take care of which for many people is a better way of living.""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" stated Carlos Arturo Plaza on carfree day in Bogota, Colombia. The car free day has also promoted other things to bloom in the city such as parks, sidewalks, and restaurants that people really enjoy. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article ""The End of Car Culture,"" her children have other priorities than recieving their license because they have other things they would rather focus on that they enjoy more. All of these things promote people living a healthier and happier life.

Overall, limiting car usage is a ""winwin"" situation for everyone. Decreasing fumes and the stress of a car causes the environment and people to be happier. Promoting public trasportation or other ways of getting places is better for everyone. It is a growing trend all over the world, and for a good reason.

What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world.

Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing trend in limiting car usage in various parts of the world. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The advantages of limiting car usage are significant and include improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and greater reliance on public transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the environmental benefit it brings. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars alone account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease the amount of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere, thus helping to combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. This is evident in the case of Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. The ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and a significant reduction in air pollution. Similarly, the city of Bogota in Colombia implemented a car-free day, which led to the streets being devoid of traffic jams and reduced smog levels. By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for both current and future generations.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. In many cities around the world, traffic congestion is a major problem that causes frustration and wastes valuable time. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can alleviate traffic congestion and improve the overall flow of traffic. This is exemplified in German suburb Vauban, where giving up cars is the norm. The result is car-free streets and a peaceful atmosphere where bicycles and pedestrians have precedence. By limiting car usage, we can create more efficient and less congested roadways.

Limiting car usage also promotes greater reliance on public transportation. When suburbs are designed with the concept of smart planning in mind, they are made more compact and accessible to public transportation. Stores are placed within walking distance, and amenities are located on main streets instead of distant malls. This approach encourages people to use public transportation instead of relying solely on personal vehicles. It also makes public transportation a more attractive and convenient option for daily commuting. The success of this approach is evident in Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars and public transportation is readily available.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and significant. By reducing car usage, we can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote the use of public transportation. This not only benefits the environment but also enhances the overall quality of life for residents. It is clear that limiting car usage is an essential step towards creating sustainable and livable communities.",1,"essay

Subject: The Importance of Maintaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider the many benefits of maintaining this system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a shift to a direct popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College serves an essential role in our democracy, balancing the interests of both smaller and larger states, promoting regional representation, and ensuring a stable and fair election process.

To begin, it is crucial to understand the purpose of the Electoral College. The founding fathers established this system as a compromise between electing the President through Congress and a popular vote. As stated by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, their voting for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. This process ensures that each state's allotment of electors is based on the number of its Congressional delegation, thus providing representation for both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it offers. In a dispute over election results, the electoral vote winner typically receives a larger share than their popular vote counterpart. This avoids lengthy legal battles and provides a clear winner without causing further division among the American people.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the notion that the President of the United States should be everyone's President. Since no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates must gain trans-regional appeal. This encourages candidates to campaign in different states and address the concerns of a diverse range of citizens. By doing so, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country, preventing regional favoritism and fostering national unity.

Another significant advantage of the Electoral College is its impact on swing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on these states. This not only leads to increased voter engagement, but it also ensures that voters in swing states have a more significant influence in deciding the election. This system encourages both candidates and voters to participate actively in the democratic process, providing a fair and inclusive representation of the electorate's preferences.

The Electoral College also plays a crucial role in balancing the interests of large and small states. According to Judge Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some weight to the political influence of large states, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate. While the popular vote might be close in a large state such as Florida, the Electoral College ensures that it receives more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on the most populous states, thus giving a voice to the citizens of smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections by producing a clear winner. This avoids further complicating the presidential election process and maintains stability and efficiency in the election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical component of our democratic system. By maintaining this system, we can ensure that citizens from all regions of the country have a voice in the presidential elections, prevent prolonged legal battles, and provide stability and fairness in the election process. Although critics argue for a direct popular vote, it is essential to consider the benefits that the Electoral College provides, including certainty of outcome, regional representation, swing state influence, balancing large and small state interests, and avoiding run-off elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or require further information.

168,1,"Dear Senator, I know that you have many issues to think about and have a lot of decisions to make, but I think it the subject of the Electoral College is a very important subject for you to ponder. The Electoral College needs to be changed, we need to vote for the presidency with the popular vote. I believe that the Electoral college needs to be taken away because it's not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.

First, the Electoral College should be changed because it is not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College. The people ar voting for the president, but not really. They are actually voting for a slate of electors, who then choose what candidate there electoral votes should go to. The whole point of a democracy is to let the people of the country have a say in who is in charge, but with the Electoral College this is not happening. The people are saying who they want for president but if the slate of electors does not agree, then the votes go the other way. This was expressed in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer. In the passage he says, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes."" In addition, the Electoral College should be abolished because the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate. The Legislature is technically responsible for picking electors and theywould very well pick electors that are all against a certain candidate. Everyone says the system is so strong but is it really? The fact that a group of people opposing one candidate could be the electors for that state and could totally changed the votes doesn't make the system look so strong. Plummer adressed this situation in his passage, he stated, ""Back in 1960, segregationista in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors wiht new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. so that the popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy."" Finally, the Electoral college system needs to be taken away because it is very confusing. The whole system is just a jumble of different things. There are so many different steps and processes that tend to confuse the voters. When the voters get confused they often end up voting for the wrong candidate or making a mistake. If the voting system was just, the voters voted for who they pleased, then the votes were counted, then all the votes from states are added together, and then whoever had the most votes won, the whole thing would just be much easier. I belive that when the situation is as impportant as voting for our president, it should be as easy and flawless as possible. For example, when I was in seventh grade, I learned about the Electoral College in civics class. learing about the Electoral College was one of the hardest and most complicated thing I learned that year. How are people supossed to vote, if they have no idea how the system works?

In conclusion, I believe that the electoral college needs to be abolished becauseit's not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.",0,"dear Senator I know that you have many issue to think about and have a lot of decision to make but I think it the subject of the Electoral College be a very important subject for you to ponder the Electoral College need to be change we need to vote for the presidency with the popular vote I believe that the Electoral college need to be take away because it be not the people president when vote with the Electoral College the legislature could approve people to be elector that be all against a certain candidate and it be a very confusing process for people to understand

1175,0,"Limiting car usage has so many benefits to give us. It can even lead to saving the world. We've lived without them before so it's not the end of the world if they are gone for even just a day.

First of all, cars are responsible for pollutionnot all in the atmosphere such as the greenhouse gas emissions. According to Source 1, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. That is basically saying that having cars as often as we use them is harming the earth through their gas emissions. That cars are responsible for a certain percentage in the pollution.

Additionally, let us see about the few polluted cities or capitals such as Paris. They almost achieved a new record for pollution! But the way they are handling it is quite successful. ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" Source 2This gives them a chance to reduce significantly the pollution by half if the license plates ratio were balanced. They are taking turns in car usage and lowering pollution and it's a great bill or law to help reduce the pollution. They needed that because according to Source 2, last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found. That's a lot of pollution they have been carrying. But "" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Furthermore, there's more benefits of reducing or limiting car usage. In BOGATA, Colombia, they have a Day Without Cars and it's starting to spread to other communities as well. They want to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog and those that violates will face 25 fines. This sounds like a very great and effective idea. Many people are participating in it and not only that ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""Source 3 In conclusion, limiting car usage will give us a greater advantage not only in our businesses but also our air.

1354,1,"During my life i have watched many presidential elections on my television. To me the Electoral College on paper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that ""we"" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

 after read over my responce and the evidence that I have profide form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that I have argue my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper be good but in reality be only a crumble castle wait to fall into the tiny bite and piece that it should be"
1149,0,"In the United States, people are very busy. With school, work, and extracurricular activities in the mix of ""everything else,"" Americans rely on an efficient and preferably fast mode of transportation, and typically, their first resort is car. However, while cars are extremely convenient, they are also very dangerous to the environment. Car usage should be limited because there are many advantages, including less smog, less traffic, healthier people, and reduced air pollution.

To start off, when car usage is limited, smog and air pollution are drastically limited too. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States. This is a major problem in many different parts of the world, yet people still continue to always resort to cars, though they have many other options. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants, and the pollution that comes from it is most detrimental to the environment and ourselves. If we limit car usage, we will drastically reduce air pollution.

Furthermore, when car use is limited, it is better for humans. When people do not drive cars, they will sometimes walk, skate, or bike to where they need to be. This is exercise, so it is better for you than just sitting in a car. When people use other methods of transportation like walking, biking, or skating, they do not have to worry about being stuck in traffic for hours. Limiting car usage also saves money. When you do not drive as much, you do not have to pay as much for gas, or paying for parking. These are huge advantages.

In conclusion, there are many different benefits and reasons that we should limit car usage. We can walk, bike, skate, or even take a bus or carpool with other people. It will reduce air pollution, make people healthier, save money, and people can feel good knowing they are doing something good for the environment and themselves.",0,"in the United States people be very busy with school work and extracurricular activity in the mix of everything else Americans rely on an efficient and preferably fast mode of transportation and typically their first resort be car however while car be extremely convenient they be also very dangerous to the environment car usage should be limit because there be many advantage include less smog less traffic healthy people and reduce air pollution

891,1,"I argue in favor of keeping the electoral college because of the fact that if the popular vote and the vote in congress were to fail, there would be a backup way of casting, counting and recording votes by a qualified group of citizens, as stated in the first paragraph of the prompt. I believe the Electoral College should not be abolished also, for the reason that each candidate for president has an amount of electors chosen, varying on the state laws in effect in the given state he or she is being elected from. Also, an advantage of the Electoral College is also that the winning presidential candidate is awarded all of the electors in most states, except Maine and Nebraska, stated in the seventh paragraph.

The College also identifies which electors will represent your state at the meeting of electors, as well as the presidential candidate. Just like almost anything, the Electoral College has flaws, such as electors can be any person not holding public office, and, depending on the state, whoever selects electors may vary. Plus, not everyone can control who their electors vote for, but the Electoral College has been in effect for over 200 years, established by the founding fathers themselves in the Constitution, so why not trust that they knew what they were doing? Besides, when each party selects a slate of electors, they put their trust, which, might I add, is rarely betrayed. But there is the problem that not all winners of electoral votes will not win the national vote such an instance happened in 2000, when Al Gore had more popular votes than George Bush, yet fewer electoral votes. Even so, that was the first time since 1888, as said in paragraph 16.

There are a few practical reasons the Electoral College, even though it lacks a democratic pedigree, should be retained. Reason one is a certainty of outcome. An example is in the 2012 election, when Obama recieved 61.7 percent of electoral votes, while rodney recieved 51.3 percent of popular votes. A tie, is also possible, seeing as the total number of votes, 538, is even. Another example is how the electoral college restores some of the weight in political balance, in which large states, populationwise, lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The subject of the Electoral Coolege's method of selecting a president is controversial in the sense that it may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, such as Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California,when they know their vote will have no effect, their incentive is much less than if it were picked by popular vote.",0,"I argue in favor of keep the electoral college because of the fact that if the popular vote and the vote in congress be to fail there would be a backup way of casting count and record vote by a qualified group of citizen as state in the first paragraph of the prompt I believe the Electoral College should not be abolish also for the reason that each candidate for president have an amount of elector choose vary on the state law in effect in the give state he or she be be elect from also an advantage of the Electoral College be also that the win presidential candidate be award all of the elector in most state except Maine and Nebraska state in the seventh paragraph

265,1,"Dear Senator of Florida, Though longstanding and ""fair"" to both citizens and Congress, the Electoral College is completely unnecessary and faulty. Election by popular vote is much more practical and leaves room for less errors. First off, the Electoral College warps the perception of voting, for when citizens vote, it is not directly for the president. Also, the Electoral College leaves many loopholes, which cause many issues and disputes.

To start off, the Electoral College does not allow citizens to vote directly, like a true democracy. This is unfair, unjust, outdated, and irrational. The natural right of a citizen should be to directly vote for something of a passionate matter. Controversies are everywhere, and citizens should be able to have a direct say in what is done. In What Is the Electoral College?, the Office of the Federal Register declares, ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"" 1.6. This seems quite indirect and faulty. Can the electors be trusted? We do not know and we definitely do not want to find out. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, ""...according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" 2.9.

Moving on, the Electoral College also contains many loopholes in the system. It is very possible to have issues arise. Electors can become faithless, the number of electors for a certain state can be controversial, and legislatures can ""defy the will of the people."" In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John. F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy"" 2.11. This unfortunate fact really shows how faulty the electoral college system really is. Do we really want so many loopholes when it comes to choosing the person who will run our country?

One may say that the electoral college has less disputes than that of just the popular vote. In In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president , Richard A. Posner says, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote"" 3.18. However, this is untrue in my opinion. The Electoral College has already created so much controversy and dissension, along with faults and problems. For the wellbeing of our country, it would be best to simply get rid of the Electoral College alltogether.

Overall, the Electoral College should not exist choosing the president should rely on simply the popular vote. The Electoral College is not a direct way for citizens to vote, which shows signs of America not being a true democracy. Also, the Electoral College has many loopholes that are sources of dispute and issues in America. To sum it up, this method of choosing the president, is irrational, unfair, unjust, and outdated. The Electoral College should be abolished.",0,"dear Senator of Florida though longstanding and fair to both citizen and Congress the Electoral College be completely unnecessary and faulty election by popular vote be much more practical and leave room for less error first off the Electoral College warp the perception of voting for when citizen vote it be not directly for the president also the Electoral College leave many loophole which cause many issue and dispute

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the information provided in the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner. Based on the evidence presented, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for the following reasons: its practicality, certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power among states, and avoidance of run-off elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College has proven to be a practical method for electing the President of the United States. The founding fathers established it as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. The process of selecting electors, the meeting of these electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress ensure a fair and constitutionally sound election process. The Electoral College has been successfully used for centuries and changing it would require significant modifications to the Constitution.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in presidential elections. The winner-take-all system in most states means that the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes becomes the President. This system reduces the likelihood of disputes over the popular vote and ensures a clear outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, a dispute over the popular vote is more probable than a dispute over the Electoral College vote. Therefore, maintaining the Electoral College ensures a more stable and predictable election process.

In addition, the Electoral College promotes representation of all regions in the United States. It requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning specific regions and encourages them to campaign across the entire country. It ensures that the interests and concerns of all regions are taken into account in the election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College emphasizes the importance of swing states. This system incentivizes candidates to dedicate more attention and resources to states where the election outcome is uncertain. As a result, voters in these swing states are more likely to be engaged and informed about the candidates' positions and policies. Their thoughtful votes should have a significant influence in deciding the election, and the Electoral College ensures that their voices are heard.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the power among small and large states. The system helps to restore some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. As Judge Posner explains, the Electoral College allows large states to receive more attention from presidential candidates compared to small states. This ensures that candidates must consider the needs and interests of diverse states, promoting a more balanced representation of the nation as a whole.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, avoiding the complications and costs associated with run-off elections. This ensures that the election process remains efficient and effective.

While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote, such as greater fairness to voters and increased attention to all states, the existing system of the Electoral College has proven to be functional, practical, and has multiple advantages that outweigh these potential benefits.

In conclusion, it is important to maintain the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its practicality, certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power among states, and avoidance of run-off elections make it a valuable and effective system. I encourage you to consider these points when evaluating any potential changes to the electoral process.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments presented and make an informed decision that best serves the interests of our nation and its citizens.

785,1,"Dear Florida Senator, There is a major problem in how we elect presidents. The electoral College has to be replaced with a direct election because of how misrepresented many voters are, and how a candidate could lose the majority vote and yet still win the election.

The first problem of the Electoral College is that everyone is not represented. According to Bradford Plumer in paragraph 10, ""... voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president... Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" and because the voters cannot directly control who they vote for, the electors could choosing a different person than who they said they would, which means that the voters are misrepresented. Another way that voters can become misrepresented is because of confusion. Since voters sometimes get confused about who the electors are voting for, they could end up voting for the wrong person. Also, the Office of the Federal Register states in paragraph 7 ""Most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation"". Due to the ""winnertakeall"" system, many people are not represented in the electoral votes, especially in large, one sidedstates. As a result of this, many of the minorities do not even vote because they know that their vote will not win the state.

Another reason that the electoral College should be replaced with a direct vote is because of how the majority does not get the candidate they chose. In paragraph 16, Richard A. Posner states that ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the firs time since 1888."" and because of the fact that the electoral votes are the deciding factor in choosing a president and not the majority, most of America did not get who they wanted to see as their leader and president. Even though this hardly ever occurs, it still hasto be fixed. As a result, Bradford Plumer states in paragraph 9, that ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" which would be a true democracy, unlike the Eectoral College. The Electoral College also has an even number of people in it, which means there could be a tie. However, the Electoral College ""requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"" according to Richard A. Posner in paragraph 19. This is not a good thing because when a certain state or region is struggling, a transregional president will not focus their attention on that area of weakness. In a direct democracy, the voters could vote for a president that has an area of expertise in that region or state and could give them a much needed boost, leading to less weaknesses and an allaround better country.

To summarize this completely, the Electoral College has to go. It is unfair, misrepresentful, and is not even a democracy. Eventualy, it has to change.",0,"Dear Florida Senator there be a major problem in how we elect president the electoral College have to be replace with a direct election because of how misrepresent many voter be and how a candidate could lose the majority vote and yet still win the election

2174,1,"Dear Senator,

I am writing today to express my opinion on the current process of electing the President of the United States that involves the Electoral College. I strongly believe that while the system has some significant flaws, it should be preserved and reformed rather than entirely abolished.

As highlighted in ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College is enshrined within our Constitution as a compromise, striking a balance between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and, alternatively, a popular vote of qualified citizens (1). This system serves as a mechanism to ensure every part of the country, regardless of population size, has representation.

Judge Richard A. Posner offers a practical defense of the Electoral College, stating it ensures a ""certainty of outcome"" (18) due to its winner-take-all system, a seldom disputed election result. He further argues this approach requires a presidential candidate to have a ""trans-regional appeal"" (19), thus facilitating a balance of regional interests and avoiding a disproportionate focus on heavily populated areas. This ensures that any successful presidential candidate is representative of the nation as a whole, which would not be guaranteed under a popular vote arrangement.

However, I acknowledge the criticisms of the Electoral College, outlined by Bradford Plumer. Important points raised include the lack of democratic pedigree with no direct link between the public's vote and the election result, and potential scenarios for election crises, such as ""faithless"" electors defying the will of the people (11). Additionally, the winner-take-all system may lead to neglect towards safe states, undermining the principle of equal representation (13).

Addressing these valid concerns, we need to reform the Electoral College rather than abolish it. One possible solution could be to adopt the proportional representation system of Maine and Nebraska nationwide (7). This would ensure that no state is ignored due to its safe state status and that all votes in every state will count towards the election result. As a result, more people would be encouraged to participate in the voting process.

Senator, I urge you to consider these points and advocate for reform of the Electoral College system. Although it is an imperfect system, it preserves vital elements of our federalist system, creating a balanced representation across states. With meaningful adjustments, we can tackle its shortcomings and maintain the advantages it provides.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

551,0,"To get from point A to point B, whether it be from home to the park or from school to the movies, the logical answer that pops up in everyone's mind seems to be a car. automobiles such as cars and motorcycles are widely used and are integrated into every part of society. But do automobiles really need to be so rooted into everything people do as a society? Cars and motorcycles create a myriad of problems such as congestion and smog. Some societies even legally limit their community's automobile usage to attempt to correct some essential problems. Limiting automobile usage is important, because not only is it practiced globally with tremendous success, but it also largely reduces pollution caused by diesel fuel and brings to light issues within communities and accounts for their resolution.

Automobiles are thought of as a daily commodity in most urban countries, but there are some societies in which usage has been reduced or even eliminated entirely and the positive results may be shocking. In the suburban city Vauban, Germany, residents have given up automobiles for a chance at a life free of traffic sounds and stress. This experimental journey within the town has achieved these and so much more. Their streets are essentially carfree and the lack of garages and parking space allows for up to 5,500 people to live in a single rectangular square mile with any necessary stores within walking distance Source 1 Par 6. similarlyyet on a much smaller scale, Bogota, Columbia has initiated a carfree day in an attempt to eliminate the area's pollution as well as reduce stress. The day is on its third year and has done as hoped. Additionally, Bogota's once pitted and uneven sidewalks have been since replaced and made much smoother, and the city has introduced parks and sports centers, new restaurants, and new shopping centers which are blossoming and thriving Source 4 Par 28. these changes have created a society both happy and strongly bonded. As wonderful as these positive shifts in society are, limiting automobile usage can do even more.

A limit in automobile usage can also benefit communities by reducing pollutionseeing as a large majority of air pollution is created through the release of diesel fuels into the air. Paris, France legally banned personally automobile use throughout the city in order to rid the city's air of harsh pollutants Source 2 Par 10. France experiences a combination of cold nights and warm days that trap the emmisions from cars, scooters, and motorcycles Source 2 Par 15. By significantly reducing the amount of diesel fuels rising to the air to be trapped, the smog had cleared enough within mere weeks that the city was able to entirely lifted the ban. This is a major example of the advantages limiting car usage entails.

Altogether, limiting automobile usage is key to improving society and has myriad advantages such as creating a more bonded and pleasant community and reduces environmental hazards like pollution. Creating vehicular limits is a promising way to change the world as we know it for the better.",0,"to get from point a to point b whether it be from home to the park or from school to the movie the logical answer that pop up in everyone 's mind seem to be a car automobile such as car and motorcycle be widely use and be integrate into every part of society but do automobile really need to be so rooted into everything people do as a society car and motorcycle create a myriad of problem such as congestion and smog some society even legally limit their community 's automobile usage to attempt to correct some essential problem limit automobile usage be important because not only be it practice globally with tremendous success but it also largely reduce pollution cause by diesel fuel and bring to light issue within community and account for their resolution

391,0,"Some might thing cars are essential to life, but other might think they don't need them at all. Limiting car use is a good thing because it limits the amount of fog, it reduces traffic jams and crashes, and people seem to be more family oriented. i believe that limiting car usage is a very helpful thing and a great idea.

We all know how badly cars gases are are and that without those harmful gasses there wouldn't be much fog. now imagine if this happened here in America. In Paris they band driving due to the near record pollution. They did this so they could have a day where the air would clear out and there wouldn't be that much fog. Some might think this is an excellent idea, but some might say its a very lousiness idea. Limiting car usage actually helps because your limiting how much of those harmful gases you put in the air. They tried this for a certain amount of time in Paris and that do you know! The smog cleared up enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for driving your cars. Now this is just one of the many great things limiting car usage has on our planet.

Something else similar to what they did in Paris happened in Colombia. They limited the car usage for one day to free up some of the congestion that they had in the capital Bogota. This is also a great idea because people don't have to worry about crash crashing, people getting ran over, or kids getting hit by cars. People don't have to worry about a lot of harsh things, so they live a somewhat stress less life. In Bogota they are also making new parks for people because without cars you don't need to drive to parks you can just walk. People when they walk tend to have conversations with the people around them so they tend to have a more social and all in all better lifestyle. This could also help in places like New York or other very congested cities. Without all those cars filling up the roads with all there horrible gases, New York would have a very clean breathable air. Another thing is that they wouldn't have many traffic jams andor many people getting in car crashes.

One of the most important reasons why limiting car usage is an advantage is because people are more family oriented. Studies have shown that when people don't have cars they fell like they don't have and debts and fell somewhat free. This will make a person more loving and more interested in family time. Also people tend to walk more and carpool, so this causes them to car pool or walk in groups and they do all of that with their own family. In Germany the citizens say life without a car is great. One citizen said how his life was so tense when he had a car and now without a car he is mush happier. Also America the percentage of drives have gone down by a lot. This is because people are unemployed, they don't have money to buy a car, or they simply don't want to be tense and have a car.

Limiting car usage is a great ting and i believe people should at least try to make it happen. It helps reunite family's, clear the amount of fog, and it reduces car jams and accidents. Some people might think its not a very good idea but some might think it is. So people should at least try to see what happens.",0,"some might thing car be essential to life but other might think they do n't need they at all limit car use be a good thing because it limit the amount of fog it reduce traffic jam and crash and people seem to be more family orient I believe that limit car usage be a very helpful thing and a great idea

808,0,"Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, and Audi. What do these car companies have in common? Less people are intrested in them, limiting car usage in certain places has lead to the popularity and need of owning a car decrease. Which so that there are advantages to limiting car usage such as less pollution and less traffic.

To begin, limiting car usage can lessen the amount of pollution in the air. Pollution is a topic used when hybrid cars are being talked and how they use less gas and pollute less but what about no pollution at all. How can we stop pollution? By no longer needing cars because ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Elizabeth Rosenthal paragraph 5. Fifty percent in the U.S. of greenhouse gas that is outrageous. As Americans we need to see that the greenhouse gases are causing all the global warming and animals becoming extinct because the environment around them is changing in ways they aren't used to. Limiting greenhouse gases is a must if pollution one day is going to stop. Also, limiting car use can benefit getting rid of the amount of useless gases in our atmosphere. As humans we need oxygen to live but in our atmosphere we currently have less then twenty percent of oxygen. We breathe in nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, etc. In order to get rid of one or two of these gasses we need to limit the car use because limiting car use ""Will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" Elizabeth Rosenthal paragraph 34. Cars make up so much of our gas emissions which is a huge reason to why the air is so mixed with many different gasses that our body just dosen't need, and so much smog and air pollution that is heating everything up and killing our planet that we currently inhabit. Unless we have colonies on Jupiter and Mars it seems like we are only killing ourselves.

To continue, limiting car usage can help lower the amount of traffic on the street. When diriving people always get mad when there is traffic or if they are caught in rush hour, why not just say getting to my job is a two minute drive I should just walk. Plus traffic can cause accidents wether it's someone in a hurry, or road rage, or just a complete accident, they happen. France at one point banned even number licence plate cars from driving on certain days and odd number licence plate cars on another to limit pollution, but one intresting stat from when they put the restrictions in place ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France."" Robert Duffer paragraph 14. Traffic down sixty percent in such a large city which also has to help the tourist who don't have to wait so long for their taxi driver to get to the Eiffel Tower. Having traffic down such a huge percentage is an enourmous thing to have in a large area like that because an accident in that city can ruin a lot of people's days so limiting car usage can help in that situation. Also, every year in Cloumbia they have a day without cars to limit pollution and to encourage everyone to get out more and to walk and run around in the city of Bogota which is the city in which the day is held. Columbia limiting there use even if it's once a year is great where ""Rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic."" Andrew Selsky paragrah 28. Limiting car use for one day a year even helps for one day of traffic where rush hours have very little traffic where the only people on the road are the people who don't want to follow the day with no cars. Having the little bit of traffic extremely helps tourist and people who have to use cabs to get around the city to go to work.

To conclude, major car companies like BMW and Jaguar need to watch out because not only is the popularity in cars not as high anymore, the need for them might be just as low because of countries stepping in and limiting car use to help lower the amount of pollution and traffic as they are helping to make the world a better place.",0,"Mercedes BMW Jaguar and Audi what do these car company have in common Less people be intreste in they limit car usage in certain place have lead to the popularity and need of own a car decrease which so that there be advantage to limit car usage such as less pollution and less traffic

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my support for keeping the Electoral College system in place for the election of the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial part of our democratic process and serves several important purposes.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in the presidential election. With a winner-takes-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral-vote victory. This makes it less likely for disputes to arise over the outcome of the election, as we have seen in the past with popular vote disputes. The Electoral College provides a clear and definitive result, giving the American people confidence in the legitimacy of the elected president.

Secondly, the Electoral College helps to ensure that the president is the choice of the entire nation and not just a few heavily populated areas. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal and win multiple states, the Electoral College prevents candidates from focusing solely on highly populated areas while neglecting the concerns and interests of other regions. This promotes a more balanced and representative presidency, as the president is compelled to address the needs and concerns of a broader range of constituents.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states and engage with voters in those regions. These states, often considered to be representative of the diverse interests and viewpoints of the entire nation, receive more attention from candidates during election campaigns. This means that voters in swing states have a greater opportunity to engage with candidates, receive more information, and make more informed decisions when casting their votes. This promotes a more thoughtful electorate and ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a voice in deciding the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores weight to large states in the political balance. While the Senate's mal-apportionment may give smaller states more influence in the legislative branch, the Electoral College allows large states to have a greater impact on the presidency. This balances the representation of different states and prevents the presidential election process from becoming solely driven by the interests of smaller states at the expense of the larger ones.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. By creating a system where the plurality winner in each state receives all of that state's electoral votes, the Electoral College ensures that there is always a clear winner and that complicated run-off elections are avoided. This provides stability and efficiency in the election process.

While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College's impact on certain voters and states, it is important to note that it does not discourage voter participation. In fact, voter turnout in presidential elections remains significant, indicating that voters are motivated to express their political preferences. The Electoral College does not diminish the importance of individual votes but rather ensures that the election outcome represents the will of the majority while also considering the diverse interests of different regions.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves a fundamental role in our democratic process and provides important benefits that a popular vote system may not offer. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes a presidency representative of the entire nation, encourages engagement with swing states, balances representation between large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and effective way to elect the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system and its valuable contributions to our democratic process.

1347,0,"There is a new era in driving. people from all around the contry are either cutting down on driving or getting rid of there cars all together. I think that cutting back on te usage of driving a car will get people to find new ways of travel and also cut down on green house gas emissions.

There are many reasons to cut down on the driving of cars. one of these reasons is to find new ways of traveling. I'm not the only one who feels this way. there are many up and coming communitys enforcing the same idea but actual doing somthing to enforce it. ""70 percent of vaughn's families don not own cars and 57 percent of the family sold there car to move there""source 1as you can see i am not the onlyone with these belifs this neighborhood has set up certain rules and restrictions to make sure that people are either finding a place to store there car and walk and find a new means of transportation or they are selling there cars all together. Another way people like this are preventing people from driving or buying cars is they make it extremely expensive to park and store your car. like it says in source 1""car ownership is aloud but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development where car owners buy a space for 40,000 dollars,along with a home""so as you can see even though they are not making driving impossible but they are making it extremely hard to indulge in that process.

Another reason that i think we should cut down or completly get rid of driving and cas is to cut down on green house gas emissions. in the second source it says ""paris had 147 micrograms of particulate mater or PM. compared to other countries in the world that only have 114 or 79 micrograms PM."" source 2 this goes to show that just one of the smaller cities in a smaller contrie is emitting this much pollution into the air imagine how much the U.S is or china is emitting daily. when paris found out abot this they made sure that no one was driving for the next few days to ""clear the air"". and when the driving ban lifted there was already an increase in the clenleness of the air after only a few days of not a lot of people driving. And the people who were caught driving were givin a fine for driving. if we want to stop the green house gas emissions we as a contry and even a world need to find ways like what paris did to ""clear the air"" cars alone make up 12% of the green house gas emissions. now imagine our contry and planet if we were to completly cut out that 12% percent. we can do that as long as we can come up with ways and guide lines and rules to limit the use of cars.

to wrap up,i think as a contry and as a planet we need to come up with new ways and ideas on how to limit the use of cars and the green house gas emissions. and the only way to do that is to give people other options on diffrent ways of travel and to show them the statistics of how bad cars actualy are for the enviroment.",0,"there be a new era in driving people from all around the contry be either cut down on drive or getting rid of there car all together I think that cut back on te usage of drive a car will get people to find new way of travel and also cut down on green house gas emission

Florida State Senator, you must take action against thee flawed Electoral collegee!

Because of thee function of thee Electoral collegee, thee people aren't truly represented for. According to Source 2, thee votersthee ones supposedly voting for our new presidentvote for a group of electors instead. Due to thee power of thee Electoral college, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly undemocratic.

According to Source 1, thee electors are made up of people chosen by thee candidate's political party. Immediately, theese electors can easily decide on thee candidate to vote on it's just thee matter of thee amount of electors each candidate has. Also, thee electors are human beings, and everyone knows theat humans are flawed creatures. According to Source 2, electors have been replaced to be against thee opposing candidate or wait until thee last minute to vote.

Florida State Senator, as you may know, thee candidate for presidency usually go to thee ""swing"" states to win ""thee people's"" vote. People, however, from thee nonswing states are generally ignored. During thee 2000 eelection, 17 states weren't even able to see a candidate theey are voting for thee title of president. Altheough it is understandable theat candidates go to thee ""swing"" and populous states, theere is no excuse for ignoring theousands of people from thee small states.

Voters from thee nonswing states will still want to see thee candidate to decide on who to vote for, even theough theey aren't voting for thee actual candidate. The Electoral collegee is imperfect and undemocratic!

In conclusion, thee Electoral collegee and its electors must be disbanded so theat popular vote will be used in determining thee new president of thee United States. According to bothe Source 2 and 3, thee process of voting a group of people to vote for you is undemocratic. Electors, thee people making up the Electoral collegee, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider retaining this system for the election of the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College offers several important advantages that should be preserved.

One of the main arguments for the Electoral College is its ability to ensure certainty of outcome. In a winner-take-all system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election results. This was demonstrated in the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all method ensures that even a slight majority in a state can lead to a significant electoral-vote victory, reducing the likelihood of a tie.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the idea of “everyone’s president.” Since no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own, candidates must have trans-regional appeal to win the presidency. This encourages candidates to campaign across the country, engaging with voters from various regions and considering their diverse interests. It prevents candidates with only regional appeal from being successful presidents and helps avoid the feeling of disenfranchisement among residents of states where candidates focus less of their campaign efforts.

The Electoral College's focus on swing states also benefits the electoral process and encourages thoughtful voting. Candidates concentrate their campaign efforts on states where the election outcome is uncertain, which leads to increased engagement and attention from voters in these swing states. These voters are often more informed and more likely to pay attention to the candidates' messages. Allowing the most thoughtful voters to decide the election ensures that the election outcome reflects the will of the well-informed citizens.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it gives due weight to large states. Since the Electoral College is based on the number of congressional representatives, larger states have more influence than they would have in a purely popular vote system. This balance is crucial in redressing the power imbalance caused by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By providing greater attention to large states during campaigns, candidates are encouraged to address the concerns of a wider range of citizens and ensure that their interests are represented.

Lastly, by avoiding run-off elections, the Electoral College simplifies the presidential election process. Run-off elections, which would be necessary if no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, could greatly complicate the process and prolong the period of uncertainty. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College ensures a smooth transition of power and avoids potential complications associated with unresolved elections.

While some argue that a popular vote system would increase voter participation, research shows that voters in presidential elections are motivated to express their political preferences rather than exert decisive influence over the outcome. The Electoral College does not discourage participation but rather focuses it on expressing preferences rather than choosing a winner.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers important advantages that should be preserved. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages thoughtful voting through swing states, balances the influence of large states, and avoids run-off elections. While it is not a perfect system, it has demonstrated its resilience and ability to maintain the integrity of the election process. I urge you to consider these arguments and support the retention of the Electoral College for future presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

1646,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have significant advantages for individuals and communities. This is evident from the examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, where initiatives to reduce car dependence have been successful.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars contribute significantly to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some areas of the United States, the figure can go up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, emissions can be greatly reduced, leading to cleaner and healthier air for everyone. This is particularly important in densely populated areas like cities, where the concentration of cars is high.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in quality of life for individuals. In Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, residents report being happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. They enjoy walking and cycling in car-free streets, where there is less noise and pollution. Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to increased physical activity, as people are more likely to walk or cycle for shorter trips, improving their overall health and well-being.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can provide economic benefits. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced due to smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. This shows that reducing the number of cars on the road can lead to smoother traffic flow and less time wasted in traffic jams. In turn, this can boost productivity and stimulate economic growth. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation such as public transit and cycling, cities can reduce the need for expensive road infrastructure and parking spaces, saving money in the long run.

Finally, limiting car usage can promote social cohesion and community engagement. In Bogota, the car-free day encourages millions of people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as buses, bikes, or walking. This creates a sense of unity and shared experience among residents, as they witness empty streets devoid of traffic jams. It also promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle, as people are encouraged to engage in physical activities instead of relying solely on cars for transportation.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to enhancing quality of life, promoting economic benefits, and fostering social cohesion, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on individuals and communities. Initiatives like those seen in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota provide valuable examples of how reducing car dependence can lead to a better and more sustainable future.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

527,1,"The United States of America has come a long with in regards to its legal system. For example, the new laws that are currently being added to allow gay couples to marry. That shows true progress, however there are other laws that we have, which simply are not needed anymore and are quite outdated. An example of this would be the Electoral College. The system that it abides by is horrendous and unjust. In the eyes of many the Electoral College should be removed from the law and will make Democratic decisions within this country much better.

Now there are quite a few well known people who believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. These people include Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter,and Bob Dole just to name a few. One of the biggest controversial events that had to do with a failure of the Electoral College was the election of 2000. In this situation Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency due to the methods of the Electoral College. It all seems to just be an irrational method as well as a waste of time. This is to be believed because you have citizen voters who add up to the popular vote, yet afterwards it is then turned over to the electors who may be unfair and corrupted. The votes would be much simpler and much more fair if it was a direct popular vote. Not to mention that over sixty percent of voters whould prefer a direct election as opposed to the method of voting we have now.

Source 2, Brad Plumer The way that the Electoral College works is selection of electors, then a meeting of electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and finally the electoral votes are counted by Congress. All thats done is adding a middleman who makes a decision for the people who spent their time to vote for the candidates they elected. Also with this ""winnertakeall system Source 1, The Office of Federal Register it leaves those who ""chose wrong"" left with nothing, however let it be noted that in Maine and Nebraska there is a variation of ""proportional representation"". Finally, after the election the governer of your state prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which lists all the candidates who had run for President in your state as well as a list of the representing electors.

Along the lines of voting not only do voters practically have no say in who they are voting for due to basically voting for representing electors thus its up to the electors to vote for a President and Vice President, not the people of this nation. For example, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would end up voting for a slate of thirty four Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. With the very small chance that the electors won the statewide election kept in mind, they would then have to go to Congress and as a result Kerry would have thirty four more electoral votes. To be honest this whole system seems to be rediculously unnecessary and tedious. As said beofre a direct method of voting from the citizens would be more beneficial to the whole nation. In the end, that is one of the most important things to keep in mind because that is what will end up being affected the most which is the entireiety of the U.S.A.

Lets not forget that in this whle voting via the Electoral College, there is a very apparent disaster factor looming above their heads. When you put it into context that a candidate that a majority of the population of voters appealed to and voted for did not end up being elected because of the choices of the electors theres going to be a huge problem as a result. Not to mention the fact that many are afriad of the chance that there will eventually be a situtaion where there is a tie. Furthermore, this can also be taken into account in a vice versa manner because if there is a candidate that lost the popular vote but won the votes of the electors there will be ridiculous amounts of uproar to follow. In the close there are just too many comlexities and problems that follow the Electoral College and it would be for the benefit of all if it was abolished.",0,"the United States of America have come a long with in regard to its legal system for example the new law that be currently be add to allow gay couple to marry that show true progress however there be other law that we have which simply be not need anymore and be quite outdated an example of this would be the Electoral College the system that it abide by be horrendous and unjust in the eye of many the Electoral College should be remove from the law and will make democratic decision within this country much well

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a system of election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides important benefits and should be retained.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's text, the candidate who wins the Electoral College vote usually also wins the popular vote. This means that the President who is elected has a clear majority of the electoral votes and represents a broad range of states. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could lead to disputes over the result, as shown by the 2000 election. The Electoral College's winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate has a decisive victory in each state, providing a clearer mandate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a president who is representative of the entire nation. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, the requirement for trans-regional appeal means that candidates must reach out beyond their regional bases, ensuring that they address the needs and concerns of diverse populations across the country. This helps to prevent a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president and leaving large portions of the country feeling disenfranchised. The Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed choices.

The Electoral College also benefits smaller states and provides a balance of power between states with different populations. In his defense of the Electoral College, Judge Posner argues that the big states would dominate the election process if it were based solely on popular vote. By attributing electoral votes based on the number of representatives and senators each state has, the Electoral College restores some weight to the political balance of large and small states. This ensures that candidates cannot simply focus their campaigns on heavily populated areas and neglect the interests of less populated regions.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This allows for a clear winner to be determined in a timely manner, preventing prolonged election processes and potential challenges to the results. The certainty provided by the Electoral College ensures that the will of the people is respected and a president is elected without ambiguity.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a valuable and essential part of our democratic system. It provides a clear outcome, ensures representation for all regions of the country, prevents dominance by large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there may be arguments in favor of a direct popular vote, these benefits should not be overlooked. I urge you to advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College in our presidential elections.

446,0,"Families all over the world use cars on a daily basis. Cars help us get to places faster and in a more convenient way. Using cars eventually comes to a point were the environment can no longer take much of the diesel fuel, therefore car usage should be limited because its releases toxic gas to the environment, more exercise would be done, and more bicycles would be put to use. Limiting car usage would not only help people, but it would help the environment too.

First of all, toxic gas is released into the environment due to the burning fuels released by the exhaust pipe in a car. According to Robert Duffer, ""paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter pm per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london, Reuters found"" this shows how cars produce so much smog it harms the human beings lungs when inhaledsource 2. Also as stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States""source 1. This represents how much burned diesel gas we are breathing in instead of oxygen. There is a 1 in 2 chance that you will breathe in diesel fuels instead of oxygen, in the areas of high concentrated cars.

Therefore, more exercise would be done by people who limit their car time. Scince more bikes would be used the entire body is in motion ion other to get from one destination to another. Usage of bikes would also help prevent the leading cause of death in America, obessity. ""New York's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation"" these new inventions keep the United States busy and keep them from using cars, a busy city such a New York, would benefit more from the usage of bikes, trains, skateboards and skates because if not it could end up like Paris, a city full of smogsource 4. Bicycles are a great way to get around easily, ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewaalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districs have cropped out"", this excerpt explains how society has improved the conditions for bicyclist and skaters. The fixing of sidewalks helps bikers stay on a safe and smooth path to their destination. The exercises produced will help the body stay in shape and healthy.

648,1,"The way we should change the way we choose our United States president. I am against the Electoral college. I feel like with the Electoral college my vote does not matter. The Electoral college is a pretty unfair way to choose out president. I think its time to try something new. A expirement perhaps. How do we know the popular vote system doesn't work if we had not tried it. You know what they say don't knock it to you try it. We can avoid what happens in 1968 or 2000. Im just saying and im not the only one saying this but the Electoral College is unfair and irrational.

The Electoral college is a voting catastrophe. Many people fell like their vote doesn't matter or even make a difference. Their not the only ones. Some people just feel like the Electoral College is way too complicated to understand. Some just rather have their vote go straight to the president. Well they say their trust is rarely broken. Well thats still means it can be broken. Also, whats with the ""winner take all"" ? People here that say "" wait what?"". Well to start off its a little bit unfair. We the people just want to pick our president of united states not some electors who might not even be that loyal to the person you voted for any way. We young generation should try something new in the future. Which im saying that the Electoral College is a little bit old and outdated dont you think.

This Electoral College can be unfair and irrational at times. Also complicated as well. We voters wish their was an easier way to choose the president. well their is, we just haven't been using it yet. They say they want to avoid another 1968. Or, even a 2000 election. Well i haven't seen any change or concern for this matter. Instead of changing the rules , how about we change the voting systems in all. People have been trying to abolish the Electoral College for decades. People like President John F. Kennedy. Even one of our presidents was oppose to the Electoral College. Who is the Electoral Collage any way. Just some people who Dont currently hold office. Well whats the point of knowing who your voting for but not actully know who your voting for. basically voting for someone who can not be trusted or not be loyal enough. We have to vote on trust and confidence. I know i want my vote to matter.

So you see why we should change the way we choose our president. The Electoral college is a pretty unfair way to choose out president. I think its time to try something new. Many people fell like their vote doesn't matter or even make a difference. I just want to seeif any change can happen in the future. This Electoral College can be unfair and irrational at times.

432,0,"In today's world, many of us see cars as a necessary tool used to get us where we need to go in the shortest time possible. However, what many do not realize is how much restricting our usage of the personal automobile will actually help society in the long run. Decreasing our usage of the car will not only cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, but will also improve congestion and see an a boost in the economy of cities and countries around the world.

There is no doubt that cutting down on driving will greatly reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. As detailed in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, the effect of just one day of reduced driving played a significant impact on the amount of smog in Paris, France. The smog which covered the city of Paris rivaled that of Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The cause of the intense fog is thought to be diesel fuel, which is the most commonly used type of automobile fuel in France. Because of this, Paris has a very high smog concentration compared to other Western European capitals. The temporary ban on driving drastically improved the conditions in Paris, and the ban was lifted after only one day. If this idea of reducing the use of automobiles spreader to other cardependent countries such as the U.S., there is no telling how much the impact of society on the emission of greenhouse gasses will reduce.

Additionally, the increasingly popular idea of favoring walking or biking over driving to one's destination has seemed to have a significant impact around the world. In the passage ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, the capital city of Bogota, Colombia has participated in the Day Without Cars program for three straight years. This has led to an increase in the creation of bicycle paths and cut down on congestion and traffic jams normally common in the city. In addition, the uprising of parks and recreation centers has also helped to boost the city's economy. However, this program has not been restricted to Bogota, as many people from countries around the world have come to see the event. This has the potential to become an internationally now phenomena, which will greatly improve the health and wellbeing of the people of the world. New bicycling opprotunities will mean no longer getting in traffic jams and will reduce stress and congestion in the long run.

In conclusion, the limiting of car usage would have a profound impact on our society, not only on pollution and the envorinment, but on our personal wellbeing. The limiting of our dependency on cars has had a great effect on the emission of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and smog has the potential to be removed from modern cities all together the economy would also benefit, as fewer cars means fewer roads needing to be built and an increase of bicycle trails, parks, and shopping centers in walking distance of neighborhoods.

644,1,"Dear state senator, After researching the Electoral College process I find that the process should no longer be used. The process is not efficient for choosing the next US president and therefor the voting process should be changed to popular vote.

""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This makes the Electoral College not a democratic method for electing the president. This nation was founded on the belief of democracy, so when the government ignores the call for a democratic method for elections it is disrespectful towards out Founding Fathers, and especially to the citizens of the United States of America. Furthermore, state representatives may misrepresent a state, possibly by defiance. This has happened in the 2000 campaign where segregationalists defied the people and nearly succeeded in replacing the electors for those who opposed Josh F. Kennedy. Although defying the people does not happen often there is still the risk of repeating history to a greater extent.

Continuing, the ""winner takes all system"" causes states with smaller populations to be ignored. According to source 3, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote."" Larger states are paid the most attention to by candidates because they will receive more votes than compared to the number of votes a smaller state would produce. This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored candidate winning. Even more, candidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared candidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention. In contrast, it can be argued that no single region can shift a campaign greatly, nonetheless a single voters vote.

The Electoral College should be rid of. The process is not democratic and misrepresents voting citizens in more ways than one. If voters were able to directly vote for candidates then more states would actively engage in the campaign and all people would be represented equally. It would lower the chance for downfall, and the chance for incidents to occur. I propose that the next presidential election should use the process of popular vote to choose the next president for the United States.",0,"dear state senator after research the Electoral College process I find that the process should no long be use the process be not efficient for choose the next US president and therefor the voting process should be change to popular vote

1500,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:

Car usage has become so ingrained in our society that it may seem impossible to imagine life without them. However, there are several advantages to limiting car usage that are becoming increasingly apparent. This essay aims to inform fellow citizens about the benefits of reducing our reliance on cars. By examining examples from different cities around the world, we can see that limiting car usage can have positive effects on the environment, public health, and overall quality of life.

Body Paragraph 1: Environmental Benefits

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on the environment. The burning of fossil fuels in cars contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major cause of global warming. In Europe, passenger cars alone are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. In some car-intensive areas of the United States, this number can rise to 50 percent (Rosenthal, 5). By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions and contribute to a cleaner and healthier planet.

Body Paragraph 2: Improved Public Health

Limiting car usage also has significant benefits for public health. The smog and pollution caused by car emissions have been linked to various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Duffer, 16). By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and reduce the incidence of these health problems. Additionally, limiting car usage encourages people to engage in physical activity such as walking or biking, which has numerous health benefits. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day resulted in millions of people biking, hiking, and using public transportation to get to work, leading to a temporary decrease in smog and traffic jams (Selsky, 21-24). Encouraging more active modes of transportation can help combat the sedentary lifestyles that contribute to obesity and other health issues.

Body Paragraph 3: Enhanced Quality of Life

Limiting car usage can also improve the overall quality of life for citizens. In many cities, the layout of suburbs has been centered around cars, leading to long commutes, traffic congestion, and urban sprawl. By adopting a more compact and walkable approach to urban planning, we can create communities that are more accessible and enjoyable for residents. Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, is a prime example of this concept. The absence of cars has created a peaceful and pedestrian-friendly environment, where the sound of bicycles and children playing replaces the noise of engines (Rosenthal, 3). This shift in focus from cars to people can lead to safer streets, stronger communities, and a better overall quality of life.

Conclusion:

Limiting car usage offers a multitude of advantages that range from environmental benefits to improved public health and enhanced quality of life. The success stories of cities like Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia demonstrate the positive impact of reducing our reliance on cars. By implementing smart planning strategies and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is crucial for citizens to recognize these advantages and support initiatives that limit car usage in order to build a better world for ourselves and future generations.",1,"title the advantage of limit car usage

Greenhouse gasses effect the ozone layer of the earths atmosphere and that in turn effects the health of everyone breathing in the earths oxygen.

Subject: The Electoral College vs. Election by Popular Vote

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. My name is [Your Name], and I am a concerned citizen of [State]. I am writing to express my views on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and the possibility of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from various sources, including the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College for the following reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Despite occasional disputes over the outcome, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system ensures a clear winner with a majority of electoral votes, minimizing the likelihood of protracted disputes. Although the popular vote winner may not always win the presidency, such instances have been scarce throughout history. The rarity of such occurrences suggests that the Electoral College generally reflects the will of the people and produces an undisputed outcome.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" In an era of increasing regionalism, it is essential that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College forces candidates to campaign beyond their solid regional bases and appeals to voters from different regions. This ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation and not just a few concentrated areas. By preventing candidates with only regional appeal from becoming presidents, this system promotes unity and a balanced representation of diverse perspectives.

Moreover, the focus on swing states in presidential campaigns, thanks to the winner-take-all method, ensures that voters in these states receive special attention. Swing states often play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of elections, leading to greater voter engagement and informed decision-making. By allocating campaign efforts to these states, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address issues that are important to swing state voters, resulting in a more thoughtful and well-informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed by the Constitution, grants small states more influence in the political process than their population would suggest. The Electoral College further amplifies this balance by providing larger states with more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This ensures that the concerns and interests of both small and large states are heard and considered in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College allows for clear winners and avoids the need for run-off elections. In scenarios where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, run-off elections can significantly complicate the election process. The Electoral College, by design, leads to a clear winner who secures the majority of the electoral votes. This avoids the need for additional rounds of voting and ensures a swift, decisive outcome for the nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be an effective and balanced system for electing the president of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes the concept of ""everyone's president,"" encourages voter engagement in swing states, restores balance between large and small states, and avoids the complexities of run-off elections. While concerns about fairness and representation are valid, the Electoral College continues to be a necessary compromise that merits preservation.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my views on this important matter. I trust that you will make an informed decision that upholds the best interests of our state and nation. I look forward to witnessing the positive outcomes that the Electoral College can continue to deliver in our democratic process.

Subject: Support for the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the current Electoral College system in selecting the President of the United States. While there are arguments both for and against the Electoral College, I firmly believe that this system is essential for promoting an effective and fair democratic process.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As mentioned in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This significantly reduces the likelihood of disputes over the outcome and ensures a smoother transition of power. In contrast, a direct election based solely on popular vote may result in multiple candidates earning similar percentages of the vote, leading to prolonged run-off elections and potential political instability.

Another crucial aspect of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as highlighted by Judge Posner. Since no specific region in the United States has enough electoral votes on its own, candidates must campaign across the country and appeal to diverse interests and perspectives. This ensures that the president represents the entirety of the nation and is more likely to consider the interests of all Americans. Without the Electoral College, candidates could focus solely on populous areas, effectively ignoring the needs and concerns of citizens in sparsely populated regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system incentivizes candidates to actively engage with voters in swing states. As discussed by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus campaign efforts on competitive states. This not only increases voter engagement but also ensures that the most thoughtful and informed voters, who closely follow the campaign and its issues, have a larger role in deciding the outcome. This promotes a more educated electorate and a greater emphasis on substantive policy discussions.

In addition, the Electoral College gives due weight to the large states by counterbalancing the mal-apportionment of the Senate, as explained by Judge Posner. States with larger populations naturally have more electoral votes, which in turn attracts candidates to campaign in those states. This ensures that the concerns and interests of voters in populous states receive adequate attention, balancing the influence of smaller states and avoiding a situation where candidates disproportionately prioritize the needs of a few regions.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. As Judge Posner points out, this prevents the complication and potential disruption caused by a prolonged election process when no candidate receives a majority of votes. The Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges, providing stability and continuity in the presidential election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College discourages voter turnout, the evidence suggests otherwise. As mentioned by Judge Posner, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 presidential election, demonstrating that a significant portion of the population understands the importance of expressing their political preference. The system ensures that all votes within a state contribute to the decision-making process, regardless of whether their preferred candidate wins the state's electoral votes.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures trans-regional representation, encourages candidates to engage with voters in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. I believe that these reasons justify the continued use of the Electoral College in the selection of the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully analyze all viewpoints before making a decision that best represents the interests of our great state and the entire nation.

1012,0,"Although a motorized vehicle provides the opportunity to transport citizens from place to place, limiting the usage of a car may be considered more beneficial. Car usage limitations allow the citizens to feel less stressed, show a decrease in air pollution and a promotion towards alternative transportation, and a decrease in habit.

The article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" Source One, suburban pioneers have decided to permanently give up cars. Although the usage of cars are generally forbidden in Vauban, its fellow citizens express that they were ""always tense... are much happier this way"" without the use of a car in their lives. When individuals are stressed, they're constantly worrying and not fully paying attention to surroundings therefore, stress is considered one of the causes of vehicle crashes. Also, the congestion of traffic if not awful enough already will become worse with the crash which causes more individuals to become stressed. Without the use of cars, citizens are less stressed and can go about their daily lives. Vauban is considered to be ""the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life"" because of the attempt to make the city denser and a better place for walking has succeed.

""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Source Two, mainly focuses on the environmental issues that car usage has been causing throughout the city. After a nearrecord, pollution, Paris strictly enforced a driving ban to ""clear the air of the global city"". The smog from the motorized vehicles is hazardous to our environment which therefore can be damaging to us and our bodies if we only inhale smog. Therefore, health problems are presented among the population and causes an endless loop of health concerns to be dealt with. These can be considered ""solved"" if the environmental issues are presented and dealt with immediately and effectively. Luckily, with Paris going in the right direction with the ban, health concerns will decrease as well as the smog in the air. Because of the ban that Paris has plaaced, congestion was ""down 60 percent in the capital of France"". Presented later, the smog in the city has began to clear enough. Two beneficial causes have been brought forth all because of limitations on the usage of cars.

""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" Source Three, explains how Bogota has a dedication day to the use without cars. According to a business man, Carlos Arturo, he explains how the day of dedication relieves stress and lowers the pollution. In order to transport oneself from place to place, citizens can walk or ride bicycles. Because of the large impact that Bogota has made, ""municipal authorites from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic"". In summary, this city has made quite an influencial mark on others. With prediction, this event could end up carrying throughout the world because of the incredible benefit that it has on our planet: the decrease of air pollution. It not only helps us, but it provides help to the world. Another article, ""The End of Car Culture"" Source 4, explains that a study has been made on the American drivers: ""... are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". If this pattern continues, it'll provide implications for carbon emissions and the environment, seeing as ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"". If we could reduce this, our lives and breathing conditions can be improved dramatically. The quote, ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit"", means that if we can break the habit of buying cars, there will be no more habit to continue with.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information from various sources, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College system rather than changing to a direct election by popular vote. In this letter, I will present my reasons for this stance, addressing counterclaims and using evidence from multiple sources.

One of the main reasons I support the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out in his article, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely to occur compared to disputes over the popular vote. The winner's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, which leads to a more decisive victory. This not only provides a sense of certainty and legitimacy to the outcome, but also minimizes the risk of prolonged post-election disputes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal, as mentioned by Judge Posner. This requirement prevents candidates from focusing solely on certain regions and encourages them to campaign across the country. This is crucial for a successful president as it helps to avoid regional disenfranchisement and ensures that the president represents the interests of all Americans, regardless of the region they reside in.

Another advantage of the Electoral College system is its ability to allocate attention and resources to swing states. As Judge Posner notes, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to focus on these toss-up states. This results in more informed and engaged voters in these states, who are likely to be more thoughtful in their decision making. It also prevents candidates from ignoring certain states where they would have no chance of winning, as they know that every state contributes to their electoral vote count.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the political weight of large and small states. Judge Posner rightly points out that this system restores some balance by giving larger states more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that the voices and concerns of both big and small states are heard and considered during the campaign, which would not be the case in a solely popular vote system.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a winner is declared, as pointed out by Judge Posner. This eliminates the need for additional elections, which could complicate the electoral process and potentially lead to greater uncertainty.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the overall voter turnout in presidential elections suggests that this concern is not substantial. As Bradford Plumer notes, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite knowing that their individual vote may not swing the entire election. Voters participate to express their political preferences and engage in the democratic process, even if their state's outcome seems certain.

In conclusion, keeping the Electoral College system is essential for maintaining certainty, ensuring trans-regional appeal, focusing on swing states, balancing the political weight of states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections. Despite some criticisms and calls for change, the Electoral College remains a valuable component of our democracy as established by the founding fathers. I urge you to consider these points when evaluating any proposals related to the electoral process in the future.

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and to advocate for its preservation in the electoral process for the president of the United States. While I acknowledge the arguments put forth by those who argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several key advantages that should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As mentioned by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-takes-all system also ensures that even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory. This provides a clear and decisive result, avoiding the need for run-off elections and potential complications in the election process.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal, as stated by Judge Posner. This means that candidates must have support across multiple regions of the country in order to secure the necessary electoral votes to win the presidency. This discourages candidates with only regional appeal and promotes the idea of a president who represents the entire nation. It prevents candidates from focusing solely on populous states or specific regions and encourages them to engage with a diverse range of voters across the country.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states. As mentioned by Judge Posner, voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and engage with the candidates. This ensures that the most thoughtful and engaged voters have a significant impact on the election outcome. In a popular vote system, candidates may prioritize campaigning only in densely populated areas and neglect the concerns and interests of voters in less populous regions.

The Electoral College also balances the political power of large and small states. By allocating electoral votes based on each state's representation in Congress, the Electoral College restores some weight to the political influence of larger states, which can be overshadowed by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that candidates cannot solely rely on the support of a few heavily populated states and must pay attention to a larger range of states in their campaign efforts. This promotes a more balanced and representative approach to campaigning and governance.

Lastly, the argument that the Electoral College discourages voters in states that are not competitive is flawed. As argued by Judge Posner, voters in presidential elections are primarily people who want to express a political preference rather than those who believe that their single vote will decide the outcome. Even if their vote is unlikely to impact the election outcome in their state, voters still have the opportunity to voice their political preferences and participate in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, while imperfect, offers several advantages in the election of the president of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, encourages candidates with trans-regional appeal, promotes engagement with swing states, balances the political influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages outweigh the arguments presented by those who advocate for a popular vote system. I implore you to consider these points and support the preservation of the Electoral College in our electoral process.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my perspective on the continuation of the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States. After careful consideration and analysis of various viewpoints, I firmly believe that we should keep the Electoral College rather than switch to a popular vote system. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the Electoral College presents several advantages that should be considered in this matter.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. Unlike the popular vote, where disputes and recounts may occur, the Electoral College system minimizes the likelihood of such situations. As seen in the 2012 election, President Obama received a significant portion of the electoral votes compared to his popular vote share. The winner-take-all basis of electoral votes in most states allows for clear victory margins and reduces the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, which would then necessitate a decision by the House of Representatives.

Secondly, the Electoral College system promotes the representation of all regions across the United States. Since no single region has enough electoral votes to secure the presidency, candidates are encouraged to appeal to voters across the country. This requirement ensures that a president has trans-regional appeal and avoids the possibility of a candidate with only regional support being elected. It also prevents voters from feeling disenfranchised and reinforces the notion that the president represents all Americans.

Furthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states. In a closely contested election, candidates concentrate on states where the outcome is uncertain, thereby encouraging voters in these states to carefully evaluate the candidates and their policies. This process leads to more informed voting decisions and allows swing state voters to play a crucial role in shaping the election's outcome. By giving thoughtful voters greater influence, we ensure that the most impactful and informed choices are being made.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the influence of big and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as prescribed by the Constitution, often results in large states losing relative political weight. However, the Electoral College restores some of that balance by allocating electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress. This approach ensures that presidential candidates must pay attention to the concerns and interests of voters in both small and large states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the election process when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. By providing a clear winner, the Electoral College system avoids the challenges associated with run-off elections and ensures a smooth transition of power.

While there are those who argue against the Electoral College, citing concerns over fairness and representation, it is important to note that nearly half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite the knowledge that their individual vote may not swing the national outcome. This demonstrates that voters participate to express their political preferences rather than purely to affect the election's result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides several key advantages that outweigh the arguments in favor of a popular vote. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages voter engagement in swing states, balances the influence of big and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. While the system has its flaws, it has stood the test of time and continues to be a fair and effective method for electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I believe that retaining the Electoral College is in the best interest of our democracy and the United States as a whole. I hope you will carefully consider the advantages it offers and take them into account when addressing any proposed changes to our election system.

749,0,"What is the one thing a citizen of the united states sees just about everyday of their lives, vehicles. Vehicles are one of the most important creations America has ever had to offer but sadly there is a catch its killing this planet we call Earth. But there is a simple way to stop this atrocity from going any further. Its quite simple really all we need to do is limit our time driving. The advantages of doing this will help stop air pollution, reduce stress, and help urban and rural areas feel more like a community.

its incredible how with time communitys stopped being what they used to be. What happened to everyone knowing everyone in their community. Well if we limit the time of driving not only will we need to find people to carpool with, Americans are going to start meeting new people and start becoming more of a community again. study last year has shown that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. They either biked everywhere or carpooled with friends and family becoming dependent on other people in their communitys.

The danger and stress that comes with driving is unmeasurable. overtime you drive on the road you are putting your life and everyone your driving with lives in danger. Its only reasonable to say the less amount of people driving the less stressed Americans are.

1626,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages to both individuals and the environment. By adopting a car-free or car-reduced lifestyle, communities can enjoy improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, less traffic congestion, and better public health. This can be achieved through the development of smart planning strategies and the promotion of alternative modes of transportation.

One of the biggest advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can greatly decrease these emissions and mitigate their harmful effects. This is particularly important for areas with high car usage, such as suburbs and cities.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban due to smog demonstrates the detrimental effects of car emissions on air quality. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially those with diesel engines, we can improve air quality and create a healthier living environment for residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, showcases the positive impact of such initiatives on traffic flow. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as buses, bikes, and walking, communities can alleviate traffic congestion and create more efficient transportation systems.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve public health. The passage mentions how a car-reduced lifestyle can lead to lower stress levels and a happier life. This is supported by the statement from a resident of the car-free community, Vauban, who mentioned feeling happier without a car. Additionally, limiting car usage encourages physical activity through walking and cycling, which can reduce the risk of obesity and related health issues.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and significant. By adopting smart planning strategies, promoting alternative transportation modes, and creating car-free or car-reduced communities, we can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and enhance public health. These actions are crucial for a sustainable future and the well-being of both individuals and the environment.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

2160,1,"Senator [Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my strong views regarding the ongoing debate surrounding the Electoral College and the proposal to replace it with a national popular vote. Having reflected on the issue and weighed the evidence from various sources, I believe the reformation, rather than the complete abolition, of the Electoral College should be considered.

The Electoral College, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, is a process established by our founding fathers to provide a balance between a congressional election of the President and election by a popular vote (source 1). This process, albeit convoluted and occasionally perplexing to the American public, nonetheless underscores the unique Federal nature of our government and its commitment to representation.

For sure, critics of the Electoral College cite multiple grievances against this system, as highlighted by Bradford Plumer's ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" The system's potential to disregard popular vote, its capacity for 'faithless' electors, and the unfair advantage it affords 'swing' states are commendably legitimate concerns (source 2). 

However, as Judge Richard A. Posner asserts in his defense of the Electoral College, five crucial factors underpin the existing system's importance. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, ensures a President has trans-regional appeal, highlights the role of swing states, reinstates the balance of power for larger states, and avoids the complication of runoff elections (source 3). The argument that this system disregards potential voters in highly partisan states is valid, but it's also true that no individual vote can decisively swing a national election.

While acknowledging the Electoral College's flaws, I wish to stress the potential harm of a hasty switch to a strictly popular vote system. A direct popular vote system could prove divisive, promoting candidates catering to densely populated urban areas while neglecting rural and less populous regions (source 3). Our diversity in demographic, economic, and geographic terms necessitates a system that compels presidential candidates to seek nationwide support rather than just amassing votes in populous areas.

Instead, reforms such as those adopted by Maine and Nebraska, where electoral votes can be split proportionally, could be considered (source 1). This could alleviate some concerns about fair representation while maintaining the benefits of the Electoral College structure.

In conclusion, Senator, although I wholeheartedly agree that our current electoral system needs reformation to better reflect our democratic values, I would urge you to consider policy changes that carefully balance the need for representation and the inevitability of regional disparities. Scrapping the Electoral College wholesale may have unintended consequences that could result in even greater division in our already politically charged climate.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my views.

2057,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The modern world has been engineered for cars, but with climate change becoming an undeniable reality, it is imperative to rethink this structure. Evidence from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the United States suggests that decreasing car usage yields a multitude of environmental, societal, and personal benefits (Rosenthal, Duffer, Selsky).

In Vauban, Germany, a community free from street parking, driveways, and home garages, 70% of families live without cars. Owing to the restricted availability of parking spaces, the community has witnessed a drastic decrease in car usage, fostering a healthier environment with lesser greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal). 

Cars, although an integral aspect of suburban life, contribute significantly to greenhouse emissions, with up to 50% of the emissions in the U.S coming from car-intensive areas. Moreover, the prevalence of cars in developed and developing nations' suburbs is also a significant contributor to air pollution. The movement towards car-free or reduced car communities, such as Vauban, demonstrates the positive environmental effects of limiting car usage (Rosenthal).

Decreasing car usage is not only environmentally beneficial but also positively affects public health. Paris's partial ban on driving amid heavy pollution resulted in a staggering 60% decrease in congestion, thereby reducing the levels of harmful pollutants in the air (Duffer). The harmful effects of car emissions extend beyond environmental degradation, as they also contribute significantly to poor air quality and related health issues.

Similarly, Bogota, Colombia experienced the benefits of car-free days firsthand. The once congested streets became avenues for alternative, sustainable forms of transportation. This shift elicits a dual benefit – significantly reducing air pollution and promoting physical activity (Selsky).

The trend of reducing car reliance is not limited solely to international communities. The United States bears witness to a slight shift in behavior, with studies suggesting a decrease in car purchases and miles driven. As more people turn to public transportation and sharing services, the possibilities of a less car-dependent society become more tangible (Rosenthal).

Conclusively, lesser reliance on cars presents several advantages. For one, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions, thereby mitigating climate change and improving air quality. This, in turn, alleviates public health risks associated with air pollution. The use of alternative forms of transportation promotes physical health. Thus, working towards societies that are not centred around cars benefits the environment, public health, and overall quality of life.",1,"title the advantage of limit car usage

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College system, rather than switching to election by popular vote, is crucial for protecting our democratic principles and ensuring a fair representation of all states within the country.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President through a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. The process involves the selection of electors, their meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The allocation of electors is based on each state's Congressional delegation, providing representation for both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is that it ensures certainty of outcome. Due to the winner-take-all system employed by most states, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents disputes over the outcome of the election, as the candidate who receives the majority of electoral votes is declared the winner. In contrast, a direct popular vote could potentially lead to prolonged disputes and recounting of votes, as seen in the 2000 election.

Another significant benefit of the Electoral College is the need for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This requirement encourages candidates to campaign across various regions and build a broad coalition of support. In turn, this helps to ensure that the winning candidate has national appeal and can effectively represent the interests of the entire country. Without this requirement, there is a risk of a candidate with only regional appeal winning the presidency, which could lead to feelings of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system places importance on swing states, thereby granting more attention to the issues and concerns of those states. Campaign efforts are concentrated in toss-up states, which leads to increased engagement and thoughtful voting among their residents. This ensures that swing states, and the diverse perspectives they represent, play a significant role in deciding the election outcome.

The Electoral College also helps to restore balance to the political influence of large and small states. While the Senate provides representation for small states through equal representation, the Electoral College allows large states to have a greater say in the election. This balance is crucial for ensuring that candidates do not solely focus on the concerns of heavily populated areas but also consider the interests of smaller states.

Lastly, the use of the Electoral College system avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This prevents additional complexity in the election process and ensures a clear winner is determined.

While there are arguments for switching to a direct popular vote, it is important to note that such a change would undermine the principles on which our electoral system was built. The Electoral College helps to maintain a balance of power between states, encourages broader national campaigns, and ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions of the country.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides essential benefits including certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, focus on swing states, balance of power between large and small states, and avoidance of run-off elections. By preserving the Electoral College, we can uphold the democratic principles and ensure fair representation for all states within our great nation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College and continue to support its retention in our presidential elections.

1129,1,"Dear State Senator, In my experience, I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. If you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaign. On the other hand, i do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it.

First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some of the regiment in voters. In plumber's article he says,"" thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with.

So let me explain one of my reasons, I believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attention to the votes sent out. according to plumber's article, the Indefensible Electoral College:' he states, "" In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for who the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. If you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisified and feel that their vote would be fair.

Lastly, the second reason why I believe that getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in who they vote. If they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article, ' In Defnse of the Electoral College:', Posner states, "" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote..."" With that said, there is support that states people would have beter interest in voting if they had popular vote and no more electoral college. I believe people would actually spend more of their time on debating who should deserve to be President.

To conclude my reasons, please take them in consideration. Voters would be treated much fairly and pay more attention to voting than they do now. I believe you should get rid of the electoral college so there will be less arguing.",0,"Dear State Senator in my experience I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote if you do that the vote would become fair to voter and more voter would actually pay attention to the campaign on the other hand I do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college but let I explain to you two of the many reason why you should get rid of it

839,1,"Being a person of politics yourself, you of all people should know that many compromises have been made over the course of the establishment of the United States. However, some of the compromises, like the electoral college, were made because of factors in the past and are now not needed in today's modern democracy. While the electoral college once worked as a compromise in the past, it is an archaic system that unfairly represents the votes of citizens all across the nation. A popular vote should instead be utilized to fairly choose the people of power in this country and would better represent voters' opinions.

In implementing the electoral college, most states' votes either go to one candidate or the other, leading to candidates to only campaign in swing states Bradford Plumer 13. This may not seem like much of a problem, but consider this: a swing state such as Florida with over 20 electoral votes could go to a candidate who could have won by a 51 to 49 percent margin. This means that all the voters who voted for the other candidate no longer count, making the electoral college ineffective at voicing the opinions of the populous. Also, many states may not even see the future president at all, like in the 2000 election where the candidates did not even go once and talk in seventeen states. This leads to a poor democracy because voters in these states will surmise that if the president will not bother to visit their state, they shouldn't bother on making an educated decision when voting, or may choose to not vote at all. In a election by popular vote, presidents will have to make greater strides in getting the people's votes and citizens will then have more of an impetus in learning more about their country's government and politics.

With the Electoral College, there is also the risk that electors may not necessarily vote for the candidate the people want as president. In the Electoral College, ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" Bradford 10. These electors may not necessarily vote for what candidate voters want most as president, and could do what they might feel is the best decision however, this is not always what the majority of voters want in a president and could end up with a poor president. In addition, most voters know very little about how these electors are chosen and are not in control of who their state's electors are. In a way this system is a bit corrupt, because the voters don't have the final say of the president.

In addition, a tie is likely in an electoral vote because of swing states, which has the potential to lead to a disaster. If two candidates receive the same number of electoral votes and tie in an election, the House of Representatives then chooses the president, while the Senate choose the vice president, but their votes may not show who voters want as president, seeing that voters often vote one party for president while the other for their representatives Plumer 12. The vote for president is distributed unevenly, and states with many voters will only be represented by one vote. this could lead to the House of Representatives choosing a president that is only liked by a small population and this cannot easily be undone. Swing states are the only thing that can cause or prevent a tie in elections, and a tie has almost occured in 1976 in Hawaii and in 1968 in Ohio.

Those in favor of the electoral college argue that because candidates will focus on swing states in order to win voters in those states will pay closer attention to the election and make a more educated decision Richard A. Posner 20. However, this is not necessarily the case, and there are plenty of other welleducated voters in other states who have opinions that will never be counted because of the electoral college. If the popular vote becomes the new method in choosing the president, voters all across the nation will pay more attention to elections because they feel that their vote can make a difference, and it will. This will in turn increase the number of voters actively paying attention to their country's decisions. Because of the Electoral College, ""about onehalf the eligible American population did vote in 2012's election"" Posner 23. Although this number is mentioned as a success in Posner's arguement, this means that there is onehalf of American voices left unheard. Democracy only works if all citizens vote, but they will only take the time to vote if they know that they can make a difference.

Change needs to happen and it has to soon. If not, a poor president could be elected and then who knows what bad things could happen? With the popular vote, more people will be heard, and they will better take part in their country's government, leading to a better nation.",0,"be a person of politic yourself you of all people should know that many compromise have be make over the course of the establishment of the United States however some of the compromise like the electoral college be make because of factor in the past and be now not need in today 's modern democracy while the electoral college once work as a compromise in the past it be an archaic system that unfairly represent the vote of citizen all across the nation a popular vote should instead be utilize to fairly choose the people of power in this country and would well represent voter opinion

 with the Electoral College there be also the risk that elector may not necessarily vote for the candidate the people want as president in the Electoral College voter vote not for the president but for a slate of elector who in turn elect the president Bradford 10 these elector may not necessarily vote for what candidate voter want most as president and could do what they might feel be the good decision however this be not always what the majority of voter want in a president and could end up with a poor president in addition most voter know very little about how these elector be choose and be not in control of who their state 's elector be in a way this system be a bit corrupt because the voter do n't have the final say of the president 

 in addition a tie be likely in an electoral vote because of swing state which have the potential to lead to a disaster if two candidate receive the same number of electoral vote and tie in an election the House of Representatives then choose the president while the Senate choose the vice president but their vote may not show who voter want as president see that voter often vote one party for president while the other for their representative Plumer 12 the vote for president be distribute unevenly and state with many voter will only be represent by one vote this could lead to the House of Representatives choose a president that be only like by a small population and this can not easily be undo swing state be the only thing that can cause or prevent a tie in election and a tie have almost occur in 1976 in Hawaii and in 1968 in Ohio 

 those in favor of the electoral college argue that because candidate will focus on swing state in order to win voter in those state will pay close attention to the election and make a more educate decision Richard A. Posner 20 however this be not necessarily the case and there be plenty of other welleducate voter in other state who have opinion that will never be count because of the electoral college if the popular vote become the new method in choose the president voter all across the nation will pay more attention to election because they feel that their vote can make a difference and it will this will in turn increase the number of voter actively pay attention to their country 's decision because of the Electoral College about onehalf the eligible american population do vote in 2012 's election Posner 23 although this number be mention as a success in Posner 's arguement this mean that there be onehalf of american voice leave unheard democracy only work if all citizen vote but they will only take the time to vote if they know that they can make a difference 

 change need to happen and it have to soon if not a poor president could be elect and then who know what bad thing could happen with the popular vote more people will be hear and they will well take part in their country 's government lead to a well nation"
1712,0,"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Cars have become an integral part of suburban life, but there are increasing efforts to limit their usage. This movement, known as ""smart planning"", aims to promote alternative transportation methods and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By limiting car usage, suburbs can become more compact, accessible to public transportation, and environmentally friendly. There are several advantages to limiting car usage, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to public transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in suburban areas, these emissions can be significantly decreased. This is crucial in the fight against climate change and the protection of the environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. Car emissions contribute to air pollution, which can have detrimental effects on human health. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in densely populated areas, the air quality can be improved, leading to better health outcomes for residents. This is particularly important in cities like Paris, where smog levels can rival those of heavily polluted cities like Beijing.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can increase accessibility to public transportation. In suburbs that are designed with smart planning principles, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This encourages residents to use public transportation, walk, or bike instead of relying on cars for daily activities. By making public transportation more accessible and convenient, more people will be encouraged to use it, reducing the reliance on cars and alleviating traffic congestion.

In addition to these advantages, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. The construction and maintenance of roads, highways, and parking spaces are costly endeavors. By reducing the number of cars on the road, there will be less need for these infrastructure investments. This can free up resources to be invested in other areas such as public transportation, education, and healthcare.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage in suburban areas. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, increasing accessibility to public transportation, and saving economic resources, the limitations on car usage can have a positive impact on the environment, public health, and the overall quality of life. It is crucial for communities and governments to embrace smart planning principles and promote alternative transportation methods to create a more sustainable future.",1,"the advantage of limit car usage

701,0,"Many places around the world are limiting the usage of cars. If more places created regulations like these, it may drastically change the environment, for the better.

Vauban, a suburb in Germany, made conditions in the neighborhood almost impossible to own a car. While it may seem like an annoyance, many of the residents are happier this way. According to Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" While many people may see having to give up or not use their can an annoyance, if they get used to it they might find that not using their cars may be a good thing.

Instead of having to hear car engines and honking horns, they can take a relaxing walk or even a bike ride somewhere.

Limiting car usage would also be very helpful in cleaning up the environment. In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" the author states, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in carintensive areas in the United States."" Limiting the amount people can drive their cars could reduce a hefty amount of pollution in our air. In France, they limitied the amount of people who were allowed to drive for two days. Paris has more pollution in their air then most European cities, but putting regulations on who could drive significantly reduced the amount of smog in just a few days, according to Robert Duffer.

Putting regulations on car usage can also make the area you live in a much nicer place. In Colombia, a few cities have an annual ""Day Without Cars"", where citizens are fined for using their cars. As a result, things like restaurants and malls have been being built. They are repairing more sidewalks and building new bicycle paths. Parks are being used more often. The communities would be much nicer places with out the frequent use of cars.

Limiting the use of cars is a very good thing. It helps the environment, and it helps make the world a nicer place.",0,"many place around the world be limit the usage of car if more place create regulation like these it may drastically change the environment for the well

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and a passionate advocate for our democratic principles, I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the many benefits it provides to our electoral process.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President through a popular vote and through a vote in Congress. Its purpose is to ensure that every state, regardless of its size or population, has a voice in the selection of the President. This is vital to maintain a fair and balanced representation of our diverse nation.

There are several compelling reasons why the Electoral College should be maintained. Firstly, the certainty of outcome it provides is invaluable. While disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are possible, they are far less likely than disputes over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote, making the results clear and definitive. This avoids the uncertainty and potential chaos that could arise from a disputed popular vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is the choice of the entire nation, rather than just a few populous regions. The requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal encourages candidates to campaign across the country and consider the interests of all regions. This prevents a situation where a candidate with only regional appeal is elected, leading to disenfranchisement and a lack of representation for vast portions of our population.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This ensures that these states, which often represent diverse demographics and perspectives, receive the attention and consideration they deserve. It also motivates voters in these states to pay closer attention to the campaign and make more informed decisions, resulting in a more engaged electorate overall.

Additionally, the Electoral College rebalances the political weight of large and small states. While the mal-apportionment in the Senate already gives smaller states a stronger voice in Congress, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns of voters in more populous states. This prevents the dominance of only a few densely populated states in determining the outcome of the election and ensures that candidates address the needs of a broad range of constituents.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. This saves time, resources, and effort that would be required if no candidate received a majority of the popular vote. The Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, thereby providing stability and certainty in our electoral process.

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is unfair and outdated. However, it is important to consider the practical reasons for its retention, rather than basing our judgment solely on theoretical principles. In a diverse and geographically vast country like ours, the Electoral College ensures that every state and its citizens are part of the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic system, providing certainty, trans-regional appeal, balance, and stability in our presidential elections. I respectfully request that you continue to support and defend the Electoral College, ensuring that the voices of all our citizens are heard and represented.

Thank you for your time and dedication to serving our state and our nation.

976,1,"Politics is everywhere and it rules our everyday lives. Each United States citizen has a role in choosing how our politics can operate. It might not be a huge role but it definitely is an important small role. The presidential election happens every four years on the first tuesday of November. There is an electoral college which is the compromise between election of president by vote in congress and by popular vote of citizens. As state senator, I think you should keep the electoral college running because it is a safer option than just doing election by popular vote.

The electoral college consists of professionals in congress that are more specialized in politics then an average citizen is. The electoral college should be handed the trust to control our politics. There must be a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect that President. Each candidate running for president must have his or her own electoral group. The electors are chosen by the candidates political party, which means the person running for President if in good hands with his electoral college.

Al Gore lost the presidency, but he won the popular vote. Maybe the professionals in the electoral college saw a flaw in him that the average citizen would not see. 60% of people prefer doing the direct election popular vote. The direct election would only satisfy themselves temporarily, but what if this president that got elected put the whole country in a downfall. Then people would realize how important the electoral college is.

There are some cases where the election process ends up being a disaster. What if citizens weren't able to chose the electors and the state legislatures were fully in charge of choosing those electors. Well, the electors can still chose to go by what the people want. In 1960, the segregationist almost replaced Democratic electors with the new electors that opposed John F. Kennedy. Some electors have even went against their political party's candidate and only choose who they wanted to chose. The segregationist that were in power at that time only wanted what they thought was best for them and not what was best for the people. Situations like this must require the votes and thoughts of the average citizens combined with the electoral college.

The electoral college has voters voting for electors only and not the president. The electoral college should stick around forever. Popular votes might not always be the best option. The citizens still have a say in which electors shall be chosen and that plays a part in electing the president. Even though voters are not always able to control who the electors vote for, they still have a part in chosing who will be president.",0,"politic be everywhere and it rule our everyday life each United States citizen have a role in choose how our politic can operate it might not be a huge role but it definitely be an important small role the presidential election happen every four year on the first tuesday of November there be an electoral college which be the compromise between election of president by vote in congress and by popular vote of citizen as state senator I think you should keep the electoral college run because it be a safe option than just do election by popular vote

1112,0,"Many Americans today use cars to commute from one place to another, like work or going to school. However, in recent times, car usage has significantly decreased due to its beneficial effect on many communities. Based on the information given, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

One of many advantages of limiting the usage of cars is that it can help the community. With lower car usage, the community's environment can potentially become much better. According to Source 2, France's partial driving ban caused its congestion to go ""down 60 percent... after fivedays of intensifying smog."" This drastic change in France's car traffic prevented further pollution and smog, which hurts the community. additionally, limiting car usage can push more people into exercising more. In Bogota, Colombia, many Colombians ""hiked, biked, skated..."" during their carfree days source 3. Also, many ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city"" source 3. With an increase of exercise, the community's people will not only become healthier and fitter, but prevent any more damage to the community.

furthermore, lowering car usage will benefit the community's patrons by providing a cleaner lifestyle. With limiting their car usage, the people of the community will save more money. According to Source 1, although cars aren't recommended, a carowner may ""buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home source 1."" Normally, a decent size house is approximately 100,000 to 150,000 with parking as well. To add onto this, gas prices can become very expensive, especially to those to drive a lot. All this money spent on a pollution causing car can be put towards a child's education, or the community's benefit. Plus, the stress of ensuring a car's wellbeing at all times is eliminated as well, decreasing the amount of stress in citizens. Addionally, people are more happy with limited usage of cars. People like Heidrun Walter have said ""I'm much happier this way source 1,"" because they feel safer and can provide more to the community. Happier people in the community leads a much cleaner, stressfree lifestyle where its inhabitants are able to thrive more.

The advantages of limiting car usage includes assisting the community and providing a cleaner lifestyle for its patrons. With a positive community, the future generation's lifes will be enhanced. The youth of a community with a great outlook on the world will provide futher citizens with another fantasic community with the potential to grow and change.

93,1,"Dear senator, the Electoral College has always been a good way to elect our leaders, and it is the best way to do it. It has the ability to use swing states for better voting, larger and smaller states get different amounts of electoral votes, and presidents cannot be elected by a region alone.

The effect of having swing states because of the Electoral College is a positive one because when a state feels like they have a chance of having their candidate win, they put more thought into the vote they cast knowing that their vote counts. Having voters put more thought into their votes instead of not caring as much gives the better candidate a greater chance of winning, if one candidate was truly better than the other. The more thoughtfull candidates in a swing state will pull more information from the candidates campaigns. Popular vote does not use the winner takes all method so the idea of swing states will no longer have any effect in the election.

Another great reason why the Electoral College is better than popular vote is because depending on the size of the states a certain amount of votes is given to the electors. Larger states get more attention from presidential candidates because of the majority vote in the particular state. if there was only popular vote then presidential candidates could waste their time on smaller states when they could of been winning larger states. The varying amount of electoral votes for each state depending on its size also allows for a more equal and fair election, due to the less populated states not being able to have more electoral votes then the more populated states.

The Electoral College allows that presidential candidates cannot win the election by regional appeal. This means that if a particular region favors a candidate they cannot win by only a single regions votes. This makes the candidates campaign less in regions that are more likely to be won and more in other regions. But with the Electoral College this makes it harder for a candidate with only regional appeal to win because other regions feel like their votes will not be as effective towards the election. With popular vote a presidential candidate will not know where to campaign and where not because there is no winner take all method.

This is why I belive that having the Electoral College is superior to popular vote when we the people vote for presidential candidates.",0,"dear senator the Electoral College have always be a good way to elect our leader and it be the good way to do it it have the ability to use swing state for well voting large and small state get different amount of electoral vote and president can not be elect by a region alone

246,1,"Dear senator, The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational as Bradford Plumber stated. First of all, The electoral college consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vise President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. We should abolish the electoral college because it is unfair to voters. It's all because of the winnertakeall system that in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. They focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

One of the best arguments against the electoral college is the disaster factor. The state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960, segragationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This means that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to him.

Another issue that most people worry about is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If that happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives and the Senate would choose Vise President.

To say the least, abolishing the electoral college is the best idea. According to a gallop poll in 2000, I am not alone. The gallop poll was taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. How does the electoral college even have any defenderes left? Even in a close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism and I couldn't agree more. It is a thing from the past and should stay that way. The electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense because it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. Richard A. Posner even says that when you vote for a presidential candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors.",0,"dear senator the Electoral College be unfair outdated and irrational as Bradford Plumber state first of all the electoral college consist of the elector the meeting of the elector where they vote for President and Vise President and the counting of the electoral vote by Congress we should abolish the electoral college because it be unfair to voter it be all because of the winnertakeall system that in each state candidate do n't spend time in state they know they have no chance of win they focus on the tight race in the swing state for example during the 2000 campaign seventeen state did n't see the candidate at all 25 of the large medium market did n't get to see a single campaign ad

 to say the least abolish the electoral college be the good idea accord to a gallop poll in 2000 I be not alone the gallop poll be take shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirk of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lose the presidency over 60 percent of voter would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now how do the electoral college even have any defendere leave even in a close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency 

 the electoral college be widely regard as an anachronism and I could n't agree more it be a thing from the past and should stay that way the electoral college be not democratic in a modern sense because it be the elector who elect the president not the people Richard A. Posner even say that when you vote for a presidential candidate you be actually vote for a slate of elector"
1676,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a topic of interest in recent years, with many countries and cities implementing measures to reduce the number of cars on the road. This movement towards smart planning and reducing greenhouse gas emissions has numerous advantages that benefit both individuals and the environment.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are responsible for climate change. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of these emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can be as high as 50 percent (Rosenthal 5). By limiting car usage and promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as public transportation, walking, and cycling, we can significantly reduce these emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In cities like Paris, smog caused by car emissions has become a major problem. To tackle this issue, the city enforced a partial driving ban, which resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a significant improvement in air quality (Duffer 14). Similar measures have been implemented in other cities, including Bogota, where a car-free day was organized to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog (Selsky 21). By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for everyone.

Aside from the environmental benefits, limiting car usage also has positive social and economic impacts. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have given up their cars and embraced a car-free lifestyle. This has resulted in less congestion, quieter streets, and a greater sense of community (Rosenthal 3). In addition, limiting car usage can lead to a more compact and accessible urban environment. Instead of relying on cars to reach stores and malls along distant highways, smart planning focuses on placing stores within walking distance or along main streets (Rosenthal 6). This not only promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle but also boosts local businesses and reduces the need for large parking spaces.

While there may be concerns about the inconvenience of limiting car usage, there are many alternative forms of transportation available. Public transportation systems can be expanded and improved to provide efficient and affordable options for commuting. Walking and cycling infrastructure can be developed to make these modes of transportation safer and more accessible. Car-sharing and ride-sharing services can also provide convenient alternatives for those who need occasional access to a car.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that benefit individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible urban environments, we can create a sustainable and healthier future for all. It is time to embrace smart planning, explore alternative forms of transportation, and reduce our reliance on cars.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

1295,1,"Dear Mr. President, As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first amendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a ""popular"" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Bestlaid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the ""privilege"" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted candidate A, but North Dakota voted for candidate B, candidate A is bound to win because Florida has twentynine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one candidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first candidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised?

206,0,"Cars have been a great way of transportation that has been around since the early days. It's a fast and simple way of getting to where you need to be at the right time. However, there are many downsides to cars, also, especially when it deals with environmental circumstances. Therefore, car use should be limited due the fact that limiting car use will reduce greenhouse gasses, conserve resources we need in order to live that is nonrenewable, and allows for communities to be more connected by preserving the environment.

To begin with, car usage is becoming a major issue for the world today due to pollution. Greenhouse gasses are being leaked into the atmosphere each day to cars' transmission fuels. According to Source 1, it states, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" These gasses damage ecosystems, and leave many environments unstable due to its destruction. It can also effect human beings, also. According to Source 2, the passage says, ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" This pollution that is occurring around the world can damage our health if not taken care of. By limiting car usage, it would not only benefit the environment, but our health also.

Preceding on, along with the benefits of the environment and our health, limiting car usage will also save help save many resources we use in cars that is nonrenewable resources. Nonrenewable resources are resources that can not be replaced when it is used up. These resources are resources that are important to our every day lives, as we've gotten used to having these resources and would suffer without them. According to Source 2, it states, ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compares to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters."" Diesel is an important nonrenewable resource that we need that is causing pollution and smog in many places. By limiting the car usage, it would conserve these resources.

furthermore, limiting car usage would also help bring many communities together. If a whole community got together and decided to limit car usage with the whole community involved, it would give a sense of unity and benefit the community, also. An example of this was the residents of Vauban, Germany. In Source 1, the passage states ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. 'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" Due to the limiting of driving cars, many people actually felt more of a sens of relief rather than with cars. In Source 3, it says, "" Bogota, Colombia In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoif of traffic jams. It was the third straight yeat cars have been permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" This community was able to come together as a whole in order to reach the goal of reducing smog and allowing for an alternative transportation method. By limiting car usage, communities are able to act more of a community rather than individuals.

All in all, limiting car usage would be beneficial to the world. The advantages of limiting car usage would be the reduction of greenhouse gasses and smog, the conservation of nonrenewable resources used in cars, and making communities stronger by coming together to stop the driving of cars. Cars are a big and major part of the world today, but it can be more beneficial to limit it rather than continue it.",0,"car have be a great way of transportation that have be around since the early day it be a fast and simple way of get to where you need to be at the right time however there be many downside to car also especially when it deal with environmental circumstance therefore car use should be limit due the fact that limit car use will reduce greenhouse gas conserve resource we need in order to live that be nonrenewable and allow for community to be more connect by preserve the environment

828,0,"Do you know what pollution is? Have you ever taken a trip by car? Well, cars emit a significant and substantial amount of pollution into the atmosphere. Such pollution will result in a damaged atmosphere. Therefore, it is important to decrease car usage, because there are several advantages that will arise from limiting car usage.

To begin with, limiting car usage will decrease the amount of pollution in the atmosphere which will result in cleaner air and healthier cities. In ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" Robert Duffer writes, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Overusing cars in the metropolis had caused the air to become extremely and dangerously polluted. The pollution had resulted in smog, a mixture of fog and pollution from cars that is very harmful. The partial driving ban that was enacted in Paris had positive effects in the city, because after one week of the partial driving ban, the smog had cleared and the ban was rescinded for certain cars. While the ban in Paris was a way to handle the destructive pollution from cars in the city, there are only a handful of regulations that are in place towards making cities less polluted. For example, in India the air is polluted to the point where one can see the pollution that resulted from smoke from cars. In the carintensive areas of the United States, passenger cars are responsible from up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. It is imperative that more regulations are enacted in the most dangerous and polluted cities. Cleaner air can only be achieved by limiting car usage around the world, especially in the most carintensive and polluted parts of the world.

The reconstruction of the ozone layer will result from limiting car usage around the world. Burning fossil fuels and cars emitting greenhouse gases have damaged the atmosphere in a colossal way. Greenhouse gases have been exponentially breaking down our atmosphere. As cars are continuously overused in many parts of the world, the danger of radiation increases as well. The connection between the destruction of the atmosphere and increases of greenhouse gases of the atmosphere will continue to be increasing until several actions are taken to prevent such disasters. In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" some cities and towns have also gone as far as having suburbs where there are barely any cars in the streets. In such cities, the air is cleaner, people are healthier and there is air pollution as well as noise pollution. Unless we make more efforts to limit car usage around the world, the planet will be plagued by a poor atmosphere, irradiated locations and unhealthy people.

Finally, while cars are being overused around the world, there are a handful of efforts being done to protect our planet from pollution. People must be informed of the consequences of too much car usage. Even though there are just a handful of regulations decreasing air pollution, people must continue to limit car usage in order to receive positive effects.",0,"do you know what pollution be have you ever take a trip by car well car emit a significant and substantial amount of pollution into the atmosphere such pollution will result in a damage atmosphere therefore it be important to decrease car usage because there be several advantage that will arise from limit car usage

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College system in the United States or, alternatively, changing to an election by popular vote for the President. The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers as a compromise between Congress and popular vote, has served our country well for over two centuries. While it is crucial for our democracy to evolve and adapt to the changing times, I believe the Electoral College should be preserved due to its many advantages, as explained in the texts I have studied.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certain outcome and minimizes disputes over the election results. In the 2012 election, President Obama won 61.7 percent of the electoral vote, even though his share of the popular vote was only 51.3 percent. This demonstrates that the Electoral College provides a clear winner by making a candidate's victory in each state translate into a comprehensive electoral-vote victory. The certainty of outcome offered by this system is essential for a stable transfer of power.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the elected President represents the interests of diverse regions. A successful president must have trans-regional appeal rather than relying solely on regional support. By requiring candidates to gain support across various states, the Electoral College fosters national unity and prevents presidents from focusing solely on policies benefiting their strongholds. This balances the interests of all regions, ensuring that no state or group of states becomes marginalized.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to engage with citizens in swing states, ensuring that voters' voices are heard. In a nation as diverse as ours, it is crucial that candidates reach out to voters in states that might be undecided. This system guarantees that citizens in these swing states receive substantial attention, allowing them to make informed choices based on various candidates' policies and qualifications. In doing so, the Electoral College promotes an engaged and informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance to the political influence of large and small states. In a country where population sizes vary, the Electoral College allows large states to maintain influence by allocating more electoral votes to them. This balance is crucial, as it prevents sparsely populated states from being overshadowed by densely populated states in the electoral process. By preserving this balance, the Electoral College ensures that every state remains important in electing the President.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by producing a clear winner. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as in the elections of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College has prevented the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections. This efficient and decisive nature of the Electoral College system aids in the smooth functioning of our democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has stood the test of time and continues to provide numerous advantages for our democracy. It ensures a certain outcome, promotes national unity, encourages candidates to engage with citizens in swing states, provides balance to the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These reasons, as outlined in the texts I have studied, make a strong case for retaining the Electoral College system or changing to an election by popular vote. I urge you to consider these arguments when discussing any proposals related to electoral reform.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will give careful consideration to the points raised in this letter. Our democracy is dependent on thoughtful decision-making, and I hope you will support the continued use of the Electoral College system or a viable alternative.

Sincerely,

2014,0,"Title: The Positive Impacts of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons from Around the World

Evidence from numerous communities across the globe unmistakably demonstrates the numerous benefits derived from reducing car usage. From Europe to South America, cities have reaped environmental, physical, and social advantages via proactive transportation strategies. Capitalizing on these tangible benefits is essential in informing and shaping our transportation policies, consumer behavior, and urban planning.

One of the key benefits anchored on limited car usage is improved air quality. Automobiles significantly contribute to cities' greenhouse gas emissions responsible for pollution and climate change. According to Rosenthal, in suburbs, passenger cars account for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, New York Times). A vivid illustration of this is the high smog levels experienced in Paris, to the extent of rivaling Beijing, one of the most polluted cities worldwide (Duffer, Chicago Tribune). Instituting car-free days in Bogota has proven effective in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog (Selsky, Seattle Times). 

Moreover, limited car usage facilitates healthier, active lifestyles. Using other modes of transportation like cycling or walking increases physical activity among residents. This is especially evident in Vauban, Germany, where the absence of cars is replaced by the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children, making the place more livable and appealing (Rosenthal, New York Times). Similarly, in Bogota, Colombia, the implementation of car-free days stimulated a significant number of the population to hike, bike, or use buses for commuting (Selsky, Seattle Times). 

Limited car usage also contributes to quieter, safer neighborhoods. In Vauban, streets devoid of cars generate lesser noise, reducing stress among residents (Rosenthal, New York Times). Additionally, it is easier for children to play outdoors, fostering a more vibrant community life. It underscores the desired shift in our development centered around cars. As David Goldberg of Transportation for America posits, moving away from a car-centric society is necessary (Rosenthal, New York Times).

The trend towards decreasing car-related cultural influence represents an opportunity to restructure our societies and economies away from traditional car-dependency. This trend, as illustrated in Rosenthal's New York Times' article, represents a shift in priorities among a younger generation of people who increasingly use alternative methods of transport. This has the potential to have significant beneficial implications for carbon emissions, considering that transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants.

In conclusion, the potential benefits garnered from limiting car usage are substantial. Decreased air and noise pollution, healthier lifestyles, safer neighborhoods, and innovation in public transportation are all achievable outcomes as evident in international case studies. As such, it is crucial for governments, policymakers, corporations, and citizens alike to understand and embrace these benefits towards a more sustainable and health-friendly commuting culture.",1,"title the Positive impact of limit car usage lesson from around the World

2041,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Learning from Global Models

Significant climatic changes have necessitated shifts in individual and societal behavior for the sake of our planet's wellbeing. One such change, as illustrated in the readings, is the concession of car use in various regions around the world from Vauban, Germany, to Bogota, Colombia. Evidence from these global examples suggests many potential advantages of restraining car use – these include promoting healthy environments, enhancing communal interaction, and reshaping urban planning.

Vauban, Germany, demonstrates a laudable approach to car liming; 70 percent of its families do not own cars (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" passage 3). This lack of reliance on cars contributes to their peaceful and serene environment, and many inhabitants have suggested they are happier without cars (passage 3). Also, Vauban utilizes a smart planning approach that limits parking spaces and promotes the use of bicycles and trams, significantly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of the town.

Similarly, the inhabitants of Bogota, Colombia, undertake a yearly ""Day Without Cars,"" which aims to promote alternative transportation systems (""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" passage 21). The project has not only reduced air pollution, but also sparked a revolution in transportation policies, with other countries observing and intending to replicate their model (passage 26). 

Moreover, the rise of alternative transportation methods, such as public transportation and cycling, have reinvigorated the center cities that for many years had been overshadowed by the suburban lifestyle predominantly centered around private car ownership (“The End of Car Culture,” passage 31). The technological era has also played a role in limiting car usage. Telecommuting, facilitated by the internet, has considerably reduced the number of individuals commuting to and from work, thereby reducing the carbon emissions from transportation (passage 34 & 35).

Increasingly, cities globally are experiencing severe adverse environmental effects due to the high usage of private vehicles. The example of Paris implementing a partial driving ban due to near-record pollution indicates the critical need to shift away from too much car travel (“Paris bans driving due to smog,” passage 10). Drastic measures such as these can decrease pollution levels significantly, highlighting the potential benefit of striving for a car-limited society.

Limiting car usage, however, requires more than just grassroots community initiatives; it requires systemic changes to transportation policy. As noted in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, contends that changes in transportation policies that lessens the dependence on cars is necessary for sustainable development (passage 7).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car use are multi-faceted. As examples from cities like Vauban and Bogota demonstrate, reducing car usage can better the environment, increase social interaction, and reshape urban design. It is clear that the current momentum behind reducing reliance on cars must continue for the benefit of our communities and the planet as a whole. These aforementioned examples serve as a beckon to achieve such a sustainable global society.",1,"title the advantage of limit car usage learn from Global Models

90,0,"Ever since their creation, cars have been the main method of transportation. However, in recent times cars have become less popular because of the issues that they cause. Limited car use would be very advantageous because vehicles discourage physical activity, make pollution, and cost everyone money.

An advantage of limiting the use of cars is that they discourage physical activity. Reliance on a motorized vehicle for transportation from place to place results in little to no physical activity. Cars have replaced the use of bicycles, skateboards, and regular walking, their use seemingly reserved only for the youth. In a car free society such as Vaunban, Germany, the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children"" can be heard by anyone walking down the street Source 1. This clearly shows that when cars are used less, people engage in more physical activity. This is the same case for Bogota, Columbia where the Day Without Cars is a big hit. Just in the third year of this event, over 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed in the city Source 3. Limiting the use of cars is definetely advantageous because they discourage physical activity.

Limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make pollution. The billions of vehicles in the world create unbelievable amounts of pollution. In Europe, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions"" and ""up to 50 percent... in the United States"" Source 1. The pollution from the increasing amounts of cars in compacted areas ""are chocking cities"" Source 1. Nearly nothing else creates that much pollution. The only thing that cars are second to in the pollution rates are the monstrous power plants that continuously belch smoke into the atmosphere Source 4. If the use of vehicles decreases, then ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" Source 4. This evidence clearly supports that the use of vehicles is causing a huge amount of pollution. Thus, limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make pollution.

Decreased use of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because the they cost everyone money. Expenses such as constant maintanance and fuel cost the average car owner a large chunk of their salary. In April 2013, the average miles driven per person was down by 9 percent, equivalent to the rate in January 1995 Source 4. The most likely cause is that ""cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars"" Source 4. The high cost of cars and their maintanace is a huge burden on the backs of the average vehicle owner. Not only does vehicles cost the individual person, but they have large effects on the government. In the sixyear federal transportation bill, the cost of the highways was 80 percent, and only 20 percent was available to all other forms of transportation Source 1. This issue has caused the legislators to get involved with the problem. Obviously, decreasing the amount of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because they cost everyone money.

1616,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The idea of limiting car usage in society has been gaining momentum in recent years. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and promote more sustainable modes of transportation. There are several advantages to limiting car usage, which include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible communities.

One of the major advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study cited in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging alternatives to car travel, such as walking, biking, or public transportation, we can significantly decrease these emissions and contribute to combating climate change.

Another benefit of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In the passage about Paris banning driving due to smog, it is stated that after implementing a partial driving ban, congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent. This reduction in car usage resulted in cleaner air and a decrease in pollution levels. By limiting car usage, especially in urban areas with high population density, we can create healthier environments for residents and reduce the negative impact of vehicle emissions on respiratory health.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more compact and accessible communities. The passage about Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, highlights how smart planning can result in the development of neighborhoods where cars are not the primary mode of transportation. Instead, residents have access to public transportation, walkable streets, and local amenities within a short distance from their homes. This approach helps reduce the need for long car commutes and promotes a more sustainable and efficient use of space.

Moreover, by limiting car usage, we can also reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and promote a more sustainable energy system. As mentioned in the passage about the end of car culture, recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, indicating a potential cultural shift away from personal vehicle ownership. This shift presents an opportunity to explore alternative modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles, shared transportation services, and improved public transit systems. These alternatives can help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible communities. By promoting alternatives to car travel and implementing smart planning strategies, we can make significant progress toward a more sustainable and environmentally friendly society. It is crucial for individuals, communities, and governments to embrace these ideas and work together to limit car usage for the benefit of our planet and future generations.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

Subject: Arguing in Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my stance on the Electoral College system and urge you to consider the benefits of retaining this method of electing the President of the United States.

The Electoral College is a process established by our founding fathers in the Constitution as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and a direct popular vote. While some argue that it is undemocratic, there are several key reasons why keeping the Electoral College is essential for the stability and fairness of our electoral system.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote system, where disputes over the outcome are more likely, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents a contestation of results, which could lead to prolonged disputes and undermine the legitimacy of the election.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions and not just those of heavily populated areas. With each state having a minimum of three electoral votes (including the 23rd Amendment, which includes the District of Columbia), candidates are compelled to have trans-regional appeal. This requirement prevents a candidate with only regional support from becoming president and guarantees that the President will be everyone's President.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. By focusing on these states, candidates have to appeal to a diverse range of voters and address their concerns effectively. This system promotes accountability and policy discussions that encompass various perspectives, ensuring that the most thoughtful voters, who pay close attention to the campaign, decide the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College recognizes the importance of balance in our political system. It gives smaller states a voice by providing each state with a minimum number of electoral votes, regardless of population size. This balance is crucial in the context of large versus small states, preventing heavily populated areas from dominating national elections and ensuring that candidates pay attention to the concerns of all states.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the complications of run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College provides a clear winner. This eliminates the need for additional elections that could prolong the process and create further uncertainty.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it is important to note that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences, rather than believing their vote to be decisive in determining the outcome. The existence of the Electoral College does not deter voter participation significantly.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its time-tested merits, is an integral part of our democracy. It ensures certainty of outcome, enables the President to represent all regions, encourages campaign focus on swing states, provides balance between large and small states, and avoids the complexities of run-off elections. For these reasons, I strongly advocate for keeping the Electoral College intact.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully examine the benefits of retaining the Electoral College and make decisions that uphold the principles on which our great nation was founded.

1079,1,"There have been a few close calls during our presidential election over the past decades, but it doesn't mean it's enough to scratch it out and throw it away. We should keep the Electoral College for many reasons, but mostly to keep chaos from happening.

To begin with, the Electoral College has been the method we have used for years for choosing our next President, so why would we change it now? Well, the answer is we shouldn't. It may seem like a good idea at first to change to the election by popular vote, but here's the problem. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The Electoral College is what helps the candidates from winning from a landslide. The Electoral consists of 583 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. So even though some may say you're not choosing your President, you're actually helping to chose your President. When you vote you're actually voting for an elector that will most likely vote for the candidate to your appeal.

Furthermore, many people such as Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and even the Chamber of Commerce have agreed to abolish the Electoral College. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Although, this all may seem like a time for change, isn't the Electoral College doing us a favor? ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" The Electoral College is a process, as a compromise established by our founding fathers, between election of the President by a vote in cCongress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

Last, but not least, the Electoral College helps with voting for President. ""Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed."" It is possible for the winner to win the electoral vote, but will not win the national popular vote. ""The Electoral College requires a candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" ""So a solid regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, that he knows he will will."" Therefor, he will not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in those states in favor of him. ""This is a desirable result because the candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.

All in all, we should keep the Electoral College because it helps balance out the nation's amount of votes for a good successful President that will help it's people.",0,"there have be a few close call during our presidential election over the past decade but it do n't mean it be enough to scratch it out and throw it away we should keep the Electoral College for many reason but mostly to keep chaos from happen

 all in all we should keep the Electoral College because it help balance out the nation 's amount of vote for a good successful President that will help it be people"

Think of all the people you will meet along every corner, when you go to the mall, the grocery store, and on your way to a friend's house. You will notice and appreciate things you haven't before, this idea is all thanks to a suburban town in VAUBAN, Germany. Now, we will be able to enjoy the sites of our surroundings and the people in it, produce less gas emissions, and a better outlook on the future.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a resident of VAUBAN, Germany. Getting rid of our cars may sound like a scary thought but in reality it can bring great things to us. When we stop bundling ourselves up in our automobiles we get to explore the world better, we get to touch and smell the things around us and appreciate them. We advance our knowledge on the things and people around us because of walking to our daily commute or day off. We also meet new people, around every corner will be a new face, maybe they or you will ask for help and from there spark a friendship. You'll find a sea of people that have the same interest as you or don't but because we no longer rely on cars we are introduced to the world more and are truly exposed to the people and things in it, giving us a better understanding of where we live and all that it has to give to us.

""Four thousand driver were fined and twenty seven people had their cars impounded for the reaction to the fine."", by Monday the smog had cleared enough and the French party rescinded the band for odd numbered plates on Tuesday. Meanwhile in BOTOGA, Colombia, it has been the third straight year that cars have been banned in the hope to promote alternative transportation and smog. This event has been so successful that ""for the first time two other Colombian cities,Cali and Valledupar, joined the event."" We all dream to live a long, happy life but in order to do so we need to treat our Earth right. When we reduce our usage of cars we can fulfill this dream.

2005,0,"Title: Limiting Car Usage: A Case for Sustainable Urban Living

The dependence on cars as the primary mode of transportation, particularly in suburban life, has resulted in numerous adverse consequences such as increased greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbated traffic congestion. Countering this culture of car usage could significantly offset these issues. By examining the experiences of places like Vauban in Germany, Paris, Bogota in Colombia, and the United States, we can gain an informed perspective on the advantages of reducing our reliance on cars.

Vauban, Germany, offers a compelling case study. In this experimental district, residents have largely relinquished their cars, with 70% of families not owning a car and 57% selling theirs upon moving to the neighborhood (Rosenthal). The resulting urban design allows for residents to enjoy quieter, less polluted neighborhoods, while still having access to transportation infrastructure, such as trams for travel to city centers. 

Further, this transformed suburban life can meaningfully contribute to decreased greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, which currently contribute to up to 50% of these emissions in car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). This feature is particularly important as global cities endeavor to cut down emissions to mitigate climate change. 

A similar pro-change sentiment was depicted in Paris when a partial driving ban reduced pollution and traffic congestion by 60% (Duffer). Furthermore, other cities such as Bogota in Colombia have been able to foster alternative means of transportation, enhancing air quality and lowering stress levels of residents (Selsky).

A growing trend in the United States also suggests Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, aided by the advent of telecommuting, resurgence of city centers, and innovations in carpooling and car sharing (Rosenthal). These practices are likely not only to be environmentally beneficial but could also have implications for transportation and auto industries, prodding them into reinventing themselves as ""mobility"" companies focused on more sustainable solutions.

Despite these gains, shifts in the culture of car usage will be shaped substantially by how younger generations perceive car ownership and usage. Interestingly, findings depict a significant drop in the percentage of young individuals getting licensed to drive, hinting at unprecedented shifts in ""car culture"" (Rosenthal). 

To conclude, transitioning from a car-centric lifestyle provides numerous potential benefits, including environmental sustainability, improved health from diminished pollution, and potentially heightened social interactions from shared transportation. While challenges persist, the experiences of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the trend in the United States demonstrate that systemic changes are both attainable and beneficial for the urban life, the environment, and the broader society.",1,"title limit car usage a case for Sustainable Urban living

We can't control whomever our electors vote for. If you keep reading you will see my reasoning for not favoring the Electoral College.

First of all, I favor changing to election by popular vote because of something we might call the ""disaster factor."" Us Americans should consider the fact about how back in 2000, there was one of the biggest fiasco of the century because of the election process. Just think about how state legislatures can just pick electors, and those electors they chose can defy the will of the people. Even if we go back even further to the 1960's the segregationists of the Louisiana legislatures almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new ones, who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

Secondly, I would prefer that he election was decided by the popular vote because some people refuse to vote. ""These electors are called ""faithless"" electors. They refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" stated in souce 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, in paragraph 11.

Last but not least of all, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Only because of the winnertakeall system in each state. Because of this system, candidates don't spend time in states they know dont have a chance of winning. They mainly focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Back in 2000, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all, which is not right.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I would rather have the decision to vote for our president by using the most popular vote. I feel that we don't actually get to make the decision of who our president actually is. I would like to say that the electoral college is unfair, irrational and outdated.

1391,0,"In the face of growing urbanization and the increasing prevalence of personal automobiles, it is imperative for us, as responsible citizens, to consider the advantages of limiting car usage. The conveniences offered by private vehicles are undeniably attractive, but a nuanced understanding of the broader implications reveals compelling reasons to transition towards more sustainable transportation alternatives. Drawing insights from various sources, including reports by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Urban Mobility Report, as well as studies on public health, this essay aims to shed light on the multifaceted benefits of reducing our reliance on cars.

One of the primary benefits of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment, as highlighted by the EPA. The transportation sector, particularly private vehicles, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions from cars contribute to climate change, posing a threat to the environment and public health. By embracing alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, or utilizing public transit, individuals can collectively reduce their carbon footprint. This shift not only mitigates the effects of climate change but also improves overall air quality, fostering a healthier environment for everyone.

Moreover, the consequences of excessive car usage extend beyond environmental concerns to encompass the pervasive issue of traffic congestion, as detailed in the Urban Mobility Report. The report emphasizes the strain on urban infrastructure caused by a high volume of private vehicles, leading to increased congestion, time wastage, and economic costs. Transitioning to alternative transportation methods, such as carpooling and efficient public transit, can alleviate these challenges. By reducing traffic congestion, we not only enhance the efficiency of transportation networks but also create more livable and accessible urban spaces.

An additional advantage of limiting car usage, as highlighted by studies on public health, is the positive impact on individual well-being. Active commuting, such as walking or cycling, has been linked to improved cardiovascular health. The sedentary nature of car travel contributes to a range of health issues, and by choosing more active modes of transportation, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This not only promotes personal well-being but also fosters a culture of health-conscious and engaged communities.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are diverse, ranging from environmental sustainability and reduced traffic congestion to improved public health. The insights from the EPA, the Urban Mobility Report, and studies on individual health collectively emphasize the need for a transition towards more sustainable transportation habits. As responsible citizens, it is incumbent upon us to recognize the broader implications of our commuting choices and actively contribute to a future characterized by environmental stewardship, efficient urban living, and the well-being of individuals and communities alike.",1,"in the face of grow urbanization and the increase prevalence of personal automobile it be imperative for we as responsible citizen to consider the advantage of limit car usage the convenience offer by private vehicle be undeniably attractive but a nuanced understanding of the broad implication reveal compelling reason to transition towards more sustainable transportation alternative draw insight from various source include report by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the Urban Mobility Report as well as study on public health this essay aim to shed light on the multifaceted benefit of reduce our reliance on car

1711,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. Additionally, limiting car usage promotes the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, which can have several positive effects on physical and mental health.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to global warming, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can make a significant impact in combatting climate change and reducing our carbon footprint.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality. Cars contribute to air pollution through their emissions of pollutants like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter. These pollutants can have harmful effects on human health, leading to respiratory problems, cardiovascular issues, and other illnesses. By reducing car usage, we can reduce the amount of pollution in the air, leading to cleaner and healthier environments.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation. Walking, biking, and public transit are all more sustainable and eco-friendly options compared to driving. Encouraging people to use these alternative modes of transportation can have numerous benefits. Walking and biking are excellent forms of exercise and can help improve physical fitness. Public transit can also help reduce traffic congestion, making commutes faster and more efficient.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. Traditional suburbs that rely heavily on car usage are often spread out, making it difficult to access essential services like grocery stores, schools, and healthcare facilities without a car. By adopting a model similar to the car-free community of Vauban in Germany, where amenities are within walking distance and public transportation is easily accessible, we can create more sustainable and efficient communities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has various advantages for individuals and the environment. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, promotes alternative modes of transportation, and creates more compact and accessible communities. By embracing these advantages and adopting smart planning measures, we can work towards a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

2111,1,"Dear Senator,

I write to you today to discuss the continuing relevance of the Electoral College in our electoral process. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, our current system might be viewed as an anachronism by some and lack modern democratic sensibilities, yet several reasons remain that warrant its preservation (15, 16). While counterarguments exist, I urge you to consider these points in light of both historical and contemporary realities.

One argument in favor of retaining the Electoral College system lies in its efficacy in ensuring certainty of outcome. Unlike the popular vote, even a slight plurality in a state assures a vast electoral-vote victory in that state (18). The system, thus, helps avoid electoral stalemates caused by narrow popular vote margins, thereby maintaining political stability.

Additionally, a presidential candidate's need for trans-regional appeal, inherent to the Electoral College, promotes national unity. It prevents scenarios where a candidate might secure the presidency by focusing solely on a few populous regions or states (19). This approach forces presidential candidates to consider the interests of the entire nation, ensuring that everyone's concerns are heard and catered to.

Born out of a compromise between direct popular vote and a Congressional vote, Electoral College system encourages candidates to devote attention to swing states, where they strive to win the public's favor (3, 20). This intensive focus motivates residents of these states to engage more with the election process, potentially leading to a more informed and thoughtful electorate.

Despite these compelling reasons, the Electoral College is not without flaws. Its ""winner-takes-all"" approach potentially silences large sections of the electorate, as Bradford Plumer points out (13). Moreover, the specter of ""faithless"" electors, although statistically rare, remains a potential threat to the system's integrity (11).

However, both the likelihood and severity of these problems are frequently overstated. For instance, as Posner mentions, presidential elections inspire voters' political expression more than their belief in materially influencing the election's outcome (23). This might offset, to some extent, the purported voter apathy supposedly caused by the Electoral College.

In concluding, Senator, I urge you to protect and uphold the Electoral College, a system that not only preserves the stability and integrity of our democratic process, but also fosters trans-regional unity and active civic participation. Please bear these considerations in mind when you debate and discuss potential changes to our electoral system.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

1302,1,"Electoral Colleges is something many people disagree with but there is a few that are for the idea. Personally i think we should get rid of the Electoral colleges for many reasons. First, when using the electoral college you do not vote for the president but you vote for a slate of electors, I think when you are voting you should have a choice for which president you vote for not electors. Using this, the electors have to win which I dont think is right.

Using electoral votes effects the people in smaller states. Big states have more of a ""voice"" to who wins the election if enough people vote. People living in smaller states have less of a chance of there choosen president to win because they dont have a large number of electoral votes. Saying that people in the smaller states know that they dont have much of a say to votes and are going to stop voting in general and stop paying attention to the campaigns.

The winnertakeall method is something that voters dont like. Candidates know that some states dont have a lot of electoral votes so they dont bother to reach out to them and dont spend time on them because they think or know they dont have a chance of winning their election. Since candidates dont go to small states that means they spend all their time in the bigger states trying to win them over and get their votes. People dont think its fair that the candidates dont make any effort to pay attention to them.

When you vote for who you want as president you dont actually vote for the president you vote mostly for a slate of electors. from the excerpt from ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" stated it is the electors that vote for presidents not us. i think that we should have more of a choice for who we want as our president but we do not.

1703,0,"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

There is a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and around the world to limit car usage and create more car-free communities. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and creating more compact and accessible suburbs. The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and include improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, better public health, and increased social connection.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change and air pollution. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and improve the quality of our air. For example, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog, and as a result, congestion decreased by 60 percent and pollution levels dropped significantly.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. Cars are often the main cause of traffic jams in cities and suburbs. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, walking, or cycling, we can decrease the number of cars on the road and improve traffic flow. This not only reduces the frustration and stress associated with traffic congestion but also saves time and increases productivity. In Bogota, Colombia, millions of people participated in a car-free day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. This event not only promoted alternative transportation but also showcased the potential for a car-free urban environment.

Limiting car usage also has significant health benefits. Cars contribute to air pollution, which can negatively impact respiratory health and increase the risk of lung diseases. By reducing car usage and improving air quality, we can decrease these health risks and improve the overall well-being of communities. Additionally, promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, encourages physical activity, which has numerous health benefits, including reducing the risk of obesity and chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help foster social connection and a sense of community. When people rely less on cars and use alternative modes of transportation, they are more likely to interact with their surroundings and engage with their neighbors. This can lead to stronger community bonds, increased social interactions, and a sense of belonging. In car-free communities like Vauban, Germany, residents have reported feeling happier and more relaxed without the stress of car ownership.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are manifold. By reducing car dependency, we can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, promote public health, and foster social connection. As cities and suburbs around the world begin to adopt smart planning principles, it is becoming increasingly clear that a shift away from car culture is not only beneficial for the environment but also for individuals and communities as a whole.",1,"the advantage of limit car usage 

 there be a grow trend in Europe the United States and around the world to limit car usage and create more car free community this movement know as smart planning be aim at reduce greenhouse gas emission promote alternative mode of transportation and create more compact and accessible suburb the advantage of limit car usage be numerous and include improve air quality reduce traffic congestion well public health and increase social connection 

 one of the primary advantage of limit car usage be the improvement in air quality car be a major source of greenhouse gas emission which contribute to climate change and air pollution in Europe passenger car be responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission and in some car intensive area in the United States this number can reach up to 50 percent by reduce car usage we can significantly decrease these emission and improve the quality of our air for example in Paris a partial driving ban be enforce to clear the air of smog and as a result congestion decrease by 60 percent and pollution level drop significantly 

 another advantage of limit car usage be the reduction in traffic congestion car be often the main cause of traffic jam in city and suburb by promote alternative mode of transportation such as public transit walk or cycling we can decrease the number of car on the road and improve traffic flow this not only reduce the frustration and stress associate with traffic congestion but also save time and increase productivity in Bogota Colombia million of people participate in a car free day leave the street eerily devoid of traffic jam this event not only promote alternative transportation but also showcase the potential for a car free urban environment 

 limit car usage also have significant health benefit car contribute to air pollution which can negatively impact respiratory health and increase the risk of lung disease by reduce car usage and improve air quality we can decrease these health risk and improve the overall well being of community additionally promote alternative mode of transportation such as walk and cycling encourage physical activity which have numerous health benefit include reduce the risk of obesity and chronic disease like heart disease and diabetes 

 furthermore limit car usage can help foster social connection and a sense of community when people rely less on car and use alternative mode of transportation they be more likely to interact with their surrounding and engage with their neighbor this can lead to strong community bond increase social interaction and a sense of belong in car free community like Vauban Germany resident have report feel happy and more relaxed without the stress of car ownership

815,0,"There was a time when cars were a new invention that everyone wanted or needed, but as of recent years cars have found themselves on the decline. There are many speculated reasons as to why people aren't as interested in getting a car and driving themselves around. One of the main theories seems to be that with new technological advancements are making carpools simple organize and knowing when and where the closest city bus will arrive easier to find out. Also, the technology of today makes it easy to contact and feel connected with your friends without having to go out and see them. Whatever the reason may be, the decline in car usage is a great advantage worldwide. The benefits of limited car usage are a better environment, less traffic stress, and healthier people.

Cars are the second most common source of air pollution in the United States. In Paris, cars were so heavily used that their pollution levels were near those of Beijing, China known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. When Parisians heard this, they took action right away. They rotated day long bans on personal cars with even numbered license plates and odd numbered licence plates. After about a week of this rotating ban, with a few exceptions, the smog levels had lowered enough that all cars could be allowed again. Luckily, this experience made the people of Paris realize how much cars were harming their environment. Cars are a large source of carbon emissions all over the world so lessening their use is essential to reviving our hurting environment.

Another advantage to limiting the use of cars is less traffic and less accidents. Public transportation drivers are more skilled and practiced than everyday drivers. Arguably, they are safer behind the wheel than your average citizen. In addition to that, having less cars on the road makes it safer to walk, bike, skateboard, or even rollerblade to your destination. Also, less cars means less traffic. Although on public transportation there are bus stops and such, traffic jams would be nearly eradicated if there were that many less cars on the road.

The last important advantage of having fewer cars is a personal health benefit. Driving can be seen as stressful. You have your life as well as the lives of people around you in your hands. Not only can the concept of driving itself be stressful, but things such as reckless drivers and heavy traffic are very hard for people to deal with patiently and safely. It would be better for people's emotional health to not have to deal with driving. Avoiding cars is also better for people's physical health in both cleaner environments and more physical activity. With the lessened levels of polution, as mentioned before, people would have cleaner air to breathe and a healthier environment to live in. The amount of physical activity in citizens would also increase. With people being able to walk, bike, skateboard, etc. to their desired destination the obesity numbers would decrease. Without cars, people's emotional and physical health would largely improve.

Overall, limiting the global use of cars would greatly benefit people worldwide. Due to the recent spread of the idea of being carfree and more concious of our environment pollution levels are already decreasing. Advantages coming from a much needed decreae in car usage also include safer roads and less stressed, healthier people. A decline in the number of personal vehicles on the road would lead to a happier, safer, and healthier world.",0,"there be a time when car be a new invention that everyone want or need but as of recent year car have find themselves on the decline there be many speculate reason as to why people be n't as interested in get a car and drive themselves around one of the main theory seem to be that with new technological advancement be make carpool simple organize and know when and where the close city bus will arrive easy to find out also the technology of today make it easy to contact and feel connect with your friend without have to go out and see they whatever the reason may be the decline in car usage be a great advantage worldwide the benefit of limited car usage be a well environment less traffic stress and healthy people

313,0,"Car use all over the world has tried to be reduced throughout the years in attempt to save the environment by using fewer green house emissions, air pollution, and smog. Participating in these measures can help. If all countries would participate, this could make a huge revolution for the world and the environment.

In Vauban, Germany the roads are almost completely car free. There are a few exceptions, but they come with a cost. Exceptions according to Rosenthal's source 1, paragraph 2 include, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" This action allows people to purchase a vehicle, but reduces the amount of people buying them because of the exorbitant additional cost for a parking garage and having to buy a house in that area too. As stated in paragraph 3, of source 1, it has resulted in ""70% of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57% percent sold a car to move here."" Also sated in paragraph 3, source 1, the people who had cars in the past were always stressed, but now without cars their stress levels have gone down, and they are much happier. Positively, in response to the people eliminating most of the car use, Vaunban has built stores and malls that are in walking distance of the people, paragraph 6, source 1.

In Paris, smog levels have been at their alltime high. In response to these problems, Paris has come up with a system that still allows driving, but reduces the amount of drivers. Their system, according to paragraph 2, of source 2, is ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" This would not only reduce smog, but also traffic jams, rush hours, and congestion by 60% says source 2, paragraph 5. This leaves Paris with a winwin. Less traffic leading to less stress, and less smog resulting in a healthier city.

Bogota, Columbia participated in a car free day too. As a result, like many others, it reduced pollution and stress. It caused a happier, healthier environment. People who didn't participate were fined 25. If you offer a punishment, it will allow people to participate because they don't want to be fined.

Also, offering other forms of transportation such as a bus, bycicles, or skating propel people to do it because they know there will be other forms of ways to get to where they need to go. Negatively, people need to be at a certain place, on a certain time, resulting in their rebellion to take place in the activities held in the city.

Positively, the large amount of participation has resulted in the growth of parks, sportcenters, malls, and reconstruction of sidewalks to promote fewer car uses, says source 3, paragraph 9.

Elisabeth Rosenthal really touches on the reduction of greenhouse gas emmision because it is better for the environment and for the health of the people worldwide. If technology continues to advance, like it has in the past years, people can continue to communicate over the phone and use car pulling to reduce the amount of cars driven daily.

Sharing cars or reducing the amount we get to use them, will also supplement safety for people by reducing car crashes which could save many lives.",0,"car use all over the world have try to be reduce throughout the year in attempt to save the environment by use few green house emission air pollution and smog participate in these measure can help if all country would participate this could make a huge revolution for the world and the environment

1501,0,"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit both individuals and the environment. As the passages suggest, there is a global movement towards separating suburban life from auto use, as part of a larger effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the quality of life in communities.

Firstly, limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, and by decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can make a meaningful impact on reducing these harmful pollutants. For example, in Europe, cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By adopting car-free or low-car lifestyles, like in the German suburb of Vauban, we can make a positive change in the environment.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality, especially in heavily polluted areas. Cities like Paris have implemented partial driving bans to combat smog and have seen congestion decrease and air quality improve. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, and walking, we can reduce the amount of harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere, creating healthier and cleaner environments for ourselves and future generations.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and accessible communities. By designing suburbs with smart planning in mind, like placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation, we can create more compact and efficient communities. This not only reduces the reliance on cars but also promotes healthier and more active lifestyles. As seen in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people participate in a car-free day each year, car-free initiatives can generate a revolutionary change in how we view transportation and urban development.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The reduction in the number of vehicles on the road can alleviate traffic congestion, leading to faster commute times and increased productivity. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation, individuals can save money on fuel and car maintenance costs. Instead of investing in personal vehicles, people can redirect their resources towards public transit systems and other means of transportation that benefit the entire community.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating sustainable communities, and providing economic benefits. As we move towards a more environmentally conscious and sustainable future, it is essential to prioritize alternative modes of transportation and promote car-free or low-car lifestyles. By doing so, we can create healthier, cleaner, and more accessible communities for everyone.",1,"limit car usage have numerous advantage that can greatly benefit both individual and the environment as the passage suggest there be a global movement towards separate suburban life from auto use as part of a large effort to reduce greenhouse gas emission and improve the quality of life in community

Subject: Keeping the Electoral College or Changing to Election by Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to you today to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. This is crucial in maintaining the stability and legitimacy of the presidency.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes unity and trans-regional appeal. As Judge Posner points out, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This requires candidates to campaign and appeal to voters in various regions across the country. Ensuring that candidates have broad support across the nation helps to prevent the development of presidents with only regional appeal. It also ensures that all Americans can feel represented and that the new president will have regard for their interests.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This gives more weight to the votes of citizens living in these states and encourages political participation and informed decision-making. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters. By focusing on swing states, candidates must address the concerns and priorities of a diverse range of Americans.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores some balance to political representation by providing additional weight to large states. Judge Posner explains that the mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states more representation than their population would suggest. The Electoral College helps to address this imbalance by allocating more attention from presidential candidates to larger states. This ensures that the concerns and needs of voters in larger states are not overshadowed by those in smaller states.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This has the potential to complicate the presidential election process and prolong the uncertainty surrounding the outcome. By using the Electoral College, a clear winner is determined, reducing the need for additional elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, these arguments do not hold up when considering the practical benefits it provides. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal and unity, encourages participation in swing states, gives attention to large states, and avoids run-off elections. These factors contribute to the stability, representativeness, and legitimacy of the presidency.

In conclusion, I urge you to support keeping the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. The Electoral College has proven to be an effective system that balances the interests of all American citizens and maintains political stability. Thank you for considering my perspective.

Sincerely,

1080,0,"Normally in everyone's mind when they are a teenager they want to have a car to go to places such as the mall, beach, etc. There are advantages though to limiting car usage. The whole planet should really hear or read about it, it's amazing to what these advantages can do for you, others, and our ecosystem.

The first of many reasons why we should limit car usage is because of greenhouse gas emissions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United StatesSource 1."" This just shows the evidence by the future if this keeps going like this the Whole entire planet would be all polluted which would make living conditions harder than they have to be. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this waySource 1."" Looking at this quote tells me that she must have been stressed with the car, maybe it was because of the traffic or the gas bill who knows, but she does feel happier without it so she must feel more at ease that her area is not cramped up with cars. In Vauban, Germany if you own a car where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner must buy a space, for 40,00, along with a home. Well sign me up with a bike or running shoes because I don't have that kind of money to spend just to live in a area with no cars.

Furthermore I would like to go to Paris, but sources state that ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitalsSource 2."" Reuters had found 147 micrograms of particulate matter or PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. That is pretty bad and knowing that people say that you must go to Paris, yeah sure for I can get polluted air into my system got it. ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" According to Reuters ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western EuropeSource 2."" Even bogota, Columbia has a ""Carfree day"" and if you don't follow the rules of carfree day you will be fined 25. Carlos Arturo Plaza stated ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" as he and his wife rode a twoseat bicycle with his wifeSource 3.

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to voice my support for the retention of the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College serves as a crucial constitutional safeguard that ensures fair and representative outcomes in our presidential elections.

The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers in the Constitution, acts as a crucial compromise between direct election by popular vote and election by a vote in Congress. This system consists of 538 electors, who represent each state's Congressional delegation. To be elected President, a candidate must secure a majority of at least 270 electoral votes.

One of the key arguments in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes surpasses their share of the popular vote. This prevents disputes over the popular vote, as witnessed in the 2000 election. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system in most states strengthens the legitimacy of the president, as it creates a decisive electoral victory rather than a fragmented outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal and strategize their campaigns accordingly. No single region, such as the South or the Northeast, possesses enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that candidates must focus on gaining support across the nation, avoiding a scenario where certain regions feel unrepresented or ignored by the president. By preventing candidates from solely catering to their regional bases, the Electoral College fosters a sense of national unity.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes attention to swing states. In recent elections, we have witnessed candidates giving greater importance to states that remain undecided, or ""toss-up states."" By doing so, they actively engage with voters in these states, stimulating their participation and ensuring that the most thoughtful and informed voters have a significant say in determining the outcome of the election. This system encourages candidates to genuinely understand and address the concerns of swing state constituents.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its support for large states. While the Senate provides mal-apportionment of representation, the Electoral College counteracts this imbalance by giving larger states a relatively greater influence. This consideration ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to issues affecting millions of citizens in these states, rather than solely focusing on smaller states. In this way, the Electoral College endeavors to distribute influence and representation more equitably.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by invariably producing a clear winner. With this system in place, there is reduced pressure for repeated rounds of voting when no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote. This streamlines the election process, preventing unnecessary delays and complications.

While critics argue against the Electoral College, claiming it is unfair and outdated, it is important to note that it has stood the test of time for over two centuries. The Electoral College ensures that the presidency represents the interests of a diverse nation and discourages the tyranny of the majority. The continued support of the majority of voters, as evidenced in various polls, demonstrates that the Electoral College enjoys widespread public approval.

In conclusion, the Electoral College safeguards the integrity and representativeness of our presidential elections. Its benefits include the certainty of outcome, the representation of diverse regions, the promotion of swing states, the balanced influence of larger states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. I respectfully ask you, as my esteemed senator, to consider these factors before making any decisions regarding the future of the Electoral College. The preservation of this institution is vital for the stability and prosperity of our nation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will weigh the pros and cons carefully before deciding on such an important issue. I have faith in your commitment to serving our state and our country to the best of your ability.

 I hope this letter find you in good health and high spirit I be write to voice my support for the retention of the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States as a concerned citizen I believe that the Electoral College serve as a crucial constitutional safeguard that ensure fair and representative outcome in our presidential election 

 the Electoral College as establish by our found father in the Constitution act as a crucial compromise between direct election by popular vote and election by a vote in Congress this system consist of 538 elector who represent each state 's congressional delegation to be elect President a candidate must secure a majority of at least 270 electoral vote 

 one of the key argument in favor of the Electoral College be the certainty of outcome unlike a direct popular vote the Electoral College ensure that the win candidate 's share of the electoral vote surpass their share of the popular vote this prevent dispute over the popular vote as witness in the 2000 election furthermore the winner take all system in most state strengthen the legitimacy of the president as it create a decisive electoral victory rather than a fragmented outcome 

 additionally the Electoral College encourage candidate to have trans regional appeal and strategize their campaign accordingly no single region such as the South or the Northeast possess enough electoral vote to elect a president this mean that candidate must focus on gain support across the nation avoid a scenario where certain region feel unrepresented or ignore by the president by prevent candidate from solely cater to their regional basis the Electoral College foster a sense of national unity 

 moreover the Electoral College promote attention to swing state in recent election we have witness candidate give great importance to state that remain undecided or toss up state by do so they actively engage with voter in these state stimulate their participation and ensure that the most thoughtful and informed voter have a significant say in determine the outcome of the election this system encourage candidate to genuinely understand and address the concern of swing state constituent 

 another advantage of the Electoral College be its support for large state while the Senate provide mal apportionment of representation the Electoral College counteract this imbalance by give large state a relatively great influence this consideration ensure that presidential candidate pay attention to issue affect million of citizen in these state rather than solely focus on small state in this way the Electoral College endeavor to distribute influence and representation more equitably 

 lastly the Electoral College eliminate the need for run off election by invariably produce a clear winner with this system in place there be reduce pressure for repeat round of voting when no candidate secure a majority of the popular vote this streamline the election process prevent unnecessary delay and complication 

 while critic argue against the Electoral College claim it be unfair and outdated it be important to note that it have stand the test of time for over two century the Electoral College ensure that the presidency represent the interest of a diverse nation and discourage the tyranny of the majority the continue support of the majority of voter as evidence in various poll demonstrate that the Electoral College enjoy widespread public approval 

 in conclusion the Electoral College safeguard the integrity and representativeness of our presidential election its benefit include the certainty of outcome the representation of diverse region the promotion of swing state the balanced influence of large state and the avoidance of run off election I respectfully ask you as my esteemed senator to consider these factor before make any decision regard the future of the Electoral College the preservation of this institution be vital for the stability and prosperity of our nation 

 thank you for your time and attention to this matter I trust that you will weigh the pro and con carefully before decide on such an important issue I have faith in your commitment to serve our state and our country to the good of your ability 

 Yours sincerely

923,1,"Dear Florida state senator, In few words, the United States should keep the Electoral Collage. Although the people may not depend on them, it does not mean that they are dependable either. The United States may have a long process of voting for a president for the country that in which only they can choose rather than the people, but it still is being done for the good of the countries future.

The process for gaining a president may be long and not allow the peoples voices to matter, but the future of the country cannot be placed on their unreliable decisions. Not all of the people are experienced on the ways of the government as the Electoral College or the House of Representatives are. In truth, you may never know that if a certified member of any one of the states is actually on the side for the greater good of the country. An enemy country may pay for any large number of citizens to elect a certain candidate that could be working for them. This could happen with the Electoral Collage. They may be paid by an organization working against the U.S. or by one of the candidates themselves for personal gain. But even if it did happen, as it claims in Source 1, by the Office of the Federal Registar, there would be the House of Representatives to also give the last vote if there were to be a tie. Source 3 states that there is an equal number of electors which gives every state a chance of getting in the matter of equally electing a candidate for president.

Many things could happen while there is a new president to be elected. As I said before: the Electoral College may be paid to pick one candidate for president over the other. Source 2, by Bradford Plumer, states that the Electoral College has its defenses. Some of its members may be replaced in a state for that states' personal gain in the matter. Even so, it would be hard to tell. For the most part, it is the unfairness of not counting the peoples thoughts and opinions. It is their country as well!

All in all, it is very unreliable to put trust in the people, or anyone, for voting a president. Not many people may like the Electoral College, or their final decision, but even then it is the best way of getting a fair vote on a president. They will be there to select the new future of the country, besides being their job to do so, as opposed to the American people having duties elsewhere. They may want a candidate over the other, but even then by the end of the day, they would be in the same square they were on even before there was to be a new president elected. Even so, if there is a change in their style of living that they frown upon, they can always alert Congress.",0,"dear Florida state senator in few word the United States should keep the Electoral Collage although the people may not depend on they it do not mean that they be dependable either the United States may have a long process of vote for a president for the country that in which only they can choose rather than the people but it still be be do for the good of the country future

1424,0,"In recent years, the debate surrounding the environmental and societal impact of widespread car usage has gained significant traction. As citizens, it is crucial for us to understand the advantages of limiting our reliance on automobiles. This essay aims to explore several key benefits that arise from reducing car usage, drawing upon evidence from various sources.

First and foremost, environmental sustainability stands out as a compelling reason to limit car usage. According to studies from environmental agencies and researchers, the emissions from traditional combustion engine vehicles contribute significantly to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By embracing alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, cycling, and walking, we can reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. This not only improves the quality of the air we breathe but also helps preserve our planet for future generations.

In addition to environmental considerations, limiting car usage can lead to substantial economic benefits. Research from urban planning experts suggests that investing in public transportation infrastructure can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and enhance overall economic productivity. Moreover, reducing the demand for personal cars can alleviate the strain on city infrastructure, leading to cost savings in road maintenance and traffic management. These economic advantages provide a compelling case for policymakers to prioritize initiatives that encourage alternatives to individual car ownership.

Furthermore, limiting car usage contributes to the promotion of healthier and more active lifestyles. Studies from health organizations consistently highlight the sedentary nature of car-centric lifestyles and the associated negative health impacts, such as increased rates of obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Embracing walking and cycling not only reduces the risk of these health issues but also fosters a sense of community as people engage more with their surroundings. Encouraging citizens to choose alternative modes of transportation can thus be viewed as a holistic approach to public well-being.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted, encompassing environmental sustainability, economic prosperity, and improved public health. As responsible citizens, it is incumbent upon us to support and advocate for policies that encourage a shift away from the current car-centric culture. By embracing alternative transportation options, we can contribute to a more sustainable and vibrant future for our communities and the planet at large.",1,"in recent year the debate surround the environmental and societal impact of widespread car usage have gain significant traction as citizen it be crucial for we to understand the advantage of limit our reliance on automobile this essay aim to explore several key benefit that arise from reduce car usage draw upon evidence from various source

71,0,"The wheel was the first step that took society into the making of the mobile car. Today millions of cars are made each year to help humans transport around the cities and streets around the world. Every vehicle that is powered by gasoline emits carbon dioxide, this gas is very harmful for the environment, it causes the ozone later to slowly dissolve and it also causes acid rains. Traffic jams is one of the many effects of having too many cars in a certain populated area. Debt has also been an influential part in the quantity of cars around the globe. Car usage and production should be drastically reduced to ensure a better future for all living things in the Planet Earth.

Furthermore, Global warming has slowly made its toll on Earth, most of which has been produced by the Carbon Dioxide gases in the atmosphere, this gas is a mayor green house gas. Over the years cars have been more extensively used and have a great percentage in world contamination, As stated in article 1 paragraph 5 ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the united states"". This being, if car production and usage are reduced, Earth will have positive reactions to this change. The levels of global warming will also be reduced all around, this will help us conserve our north and south poles for a longer period of time, keeping safe all the animals related to that area like penguinzs and polar bears.

In addition, Traffic jams arent the most pleasant place to be, due to the fact that they're unpredictable and in most cases highly annoying. Information from passage 2 paragraph 14 states that ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france"", this was due to oderly assigning days in which certain cars with certain license plates can drive through the cities of france. Less congestion means higher percent in mobility all around, this can greatly effect a 3 hour traffic jam to a simple 20 minute ride. Coming and going from places can be a brease, and this will also facilitate extra time for other potential activities. Reducing car usage and congestion can also lead to less accidents and car crashes.

Moreover, Leasing or buying a new car can come heavy on the pocket. Financial debt has been trounced ever since a currency started, debt is unpredictable sometimes and can happen to any individual. Having the latest model of a car can be a luxury only some can afford, the individuals who try and cant afford it ussually end up in debt, as reinforced in article 4 paragraph 32 ""Cash Strapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway"". Ussually some individuals ""bite more than they can chew"" and this can harm not only one indivual, but the economy as a whole. Reducing the mayor debt that can come from car leasing can improve a counrtys economy and benift milliones of individuals.

Concluding, many reasons show society to reduce the usage of cars. One being that gasoline and petrolium powered cars can contaminate the planet Earth, melt our poles, destroy the ozone layer and cause harmful weather effects. Also, the reduction of cars can lead to the decongestion of cities in which indiviuals can more easily and freely move around adding time for them to use as they like. Lastly, the economy can have a mayor boost if car reduction and usage from leasing can occur. In conclusion, the reduction of car usage and production is a great benefit for every individual who lives on Earth, and can lead to many great outcomes that will help members of society enjoy a better life style and have a safer future.",0,"the wheel be the first step that take society into the making of the mobile car today million of car be make each year to help human transport around the city and street around the world every vehicle that be power by gasoline emit carbon dioxide this gas be very harmful for the environment it cause the ozone later to slowly dissolve and it also cause acid rain traffic jam be one of the many effect of have too many car in a certain populated area debt have also be an influential part in the quantity of car around the globe car usage and production should be drastically reduce to ensure a well future for all live thing in the Planet Earth

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a direct popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that make it a vital part of our democracy.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As mentioned in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is likely to exceed their share of the popular vote. This helps avoid disputes over the outcome of the election, as was witnessed in the 2000 election. By allocating electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the Electoral College ensures that a candidate with a slight plurality in a state can achieve a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it promotes a candidate with trans-regional appeal. As noted by Judge Posner, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to campaign across the country and appeal to a diverse range of voters. This results in a president who represents the interests of all regions, rather than just one particular area.

The system of swing states, in which candidates focus their campaign efforts on competitive states, is another advantage of the Electoral College. This was evident in the 2012 election, where candidates directed their attention towards toss-up states. This system of campaigning in swing states ensures that voters in these states have a greater impact on the outcome of the election, encouraging them to pay close attention to the candidates and make informed decisions. Consequently, the most thoughtful voters become the ones who decide the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large states with the mal-apportionment of the Senate. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the Electoral College provides more attention from presidential candidates to large states, which have a greater share of electoral votes. This ensures that the interests of these populous states are not overshadowed by the smaller states and helps to maintain a balanced political system.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. As seen in the elections of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the candidates won the majority in the Electoral College despite having only a plurality of the popular vote. This system eliminates the need for complicated run-off elections and ensures a clear winner with a majority of the electoral votes.

While some critics argue that the Electoral College can discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the high turnout in the 2012 election suggests that voters still want to express their political preferences, even if they don't believe their vote will determine the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a fair and effective system for electing the President of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, balances the weight of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Therefore, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College and support its continuation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

283,1,"Dear, Senator I'am a conserend voter that believes you should represent the people of your party and should apose the electoral college. It causes an unnecessary complication for voting for who will represent the face of the best country on earth. We the people do not want to get the wrong president to represent the majority of the population. The chances of an undefined out come through electoral college may be low but when it comes down to the presidency nothing should be left to chance.

The voters should know how the system of voting for president. They are the ones that decide so they should know how there vote can be used to have the greatest affect. Bradford Plumer states ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate...sometimes"". A democracy is when the people decide the destiny of there country. For them not to know what there chosing takes power out of the hands of the people.

The Winnertakesall system is ok when your on the playground as a childs it does not work in the real world. This system creates Swing States. according to Richard A. Posner ""method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states"". This draws attention away from other states. Bradford Plumer explained that ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"". He also clames ""putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in ohio"". This is not right each vote should be just as important as another and no state should be the deciding outcome in an election.

Chance is a crazy thing. If there is a chance of something happening and it's given time it will happen. A number of weird outcomes can happen with electoral college. One outcome is the possibility of having a tie. Richard A. Posner explains""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538 is an even number"". If a tie happens the represenetives vote for the people and because each state has one vote per electoral college...""55 representatives from california, who represent 35 millon voters."". Second posible out come is the majority vote goes to one canadite and the electoral college goes to the other. For example Bradford Plumer wrote""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" These are just two of the odd outcomes of electoral colleges could cause.

Electoral college don't solve problems but creat them. The best way to put it is this...""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are most assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.",0,"dear Senator i'am a conserend voter that believe you should represent the people of your party and should apose the electoral college it cause an unnecessary complication for vote for who will represent the face of the good country on earth we the people do not want to get the wrong president to represent the majority of the population the chance of an undefined out come through electoral college may be low but when it come down to the presidency nothing should be leave to chance

630,1,"Dear Mr. Senator, The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electorss, the meeting of the electorss where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electorsal votes by Congress,"" states the article ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electorss that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation. Our presidential campaign will be much better if we change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

To begin with, the Electoral College is the cause for many issues in our nation's presidential campaign. First of all, voters sometimes cannot even control whom their electorss vote for. Ergo, one may vote for an electors of our favorite candidate's party, however, we don't know if that electors will go back on his word and vote for another candidate. The article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""The single best argument against the electorsal college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electorss, and that those electorss could always defy the will of the people"". This means that the people never know if their electorss are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate. Aside from that, their is the worrying aspect of a tie occurring. If that were to happen, then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. The article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""In 1968, a shift of just 41, 971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii had voted the other way"". This says that if those people had just voted for the opposite person, then there would have been a tie between the two candidates. Yes, those numbers seem large, but in comparison to the number of voters that there were in those years, they're a small fraction of them. This shows how close elections are with the Electoral College.

Aside from causing issues in the United States, the Electoral College is extremely unfair to voters. The article, ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register states, ""Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electorss to the winning presidential candidate"". That is not fair to other voters who don't vote for the popular candidate in their state they don't receive any electorss. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit ""swing"" states. ""Swing"" states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer says, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"". It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electorss in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electorsal votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electorss, while Maine only has 4. The article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid out defenses of the system are wrong"" states, ""Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. ' To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastrous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn't give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, ""The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid out defenses are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""It's officual: The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best.",0,"dear Mr. Senator the Electoral College have serve we for more than a century in determine our nation 's new president the Electoral College process consist of the selection of the electorss the meeting of the electorss where they vote for President and Vice President and the counting of the electorsal vote by Congress state the article what be the Electoral College write by the Office of the Federal Register this mean that we do not vote directly vote for our new president but instead vote for electorss that vote for a candidate run for office though many individual be in favor of keep the Electoral College if keep it will continue to cause problem in our nation our presidential campaign will be much well if we change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States 

 to begin with the Electoral College be the cause for many issue in our nation 's presidential campaign first of all voter sometimes can not even control whom their electorss vote for Ergo one may vote for an elector of our favorite candidate 's party however we do n't know if that elector will go back on his word and vote for another candidate the article the Indefensible Electoral College why even the bestlaid defense of the system be wrong write by Bradford Plumer state the single good argument against the electorsal college be what we might call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco be the big election crisis in a century the sytem allow for much bad consider that state legislator be technically responsible for pick electorss and that those electorss could always defy the will of the people this mean that the people never know if their electorss be go to go back on their word and vote for another candidate aside from that their be the worrying aspect of a tie occur if that be to happen then the election would be throw to the House of Representatives the article the Indefensible Electoral College why even the bestlaid defense of the system be wrong write by Bradford Plumer state in 1968 a shift of just 41 971 vote would have deadlocke the election in 1976 a tie would have occur if a mere 5,559 vote in Ohio and 3,687 vote in Hawaii have vote the other way this say that if those people have just vote for the opposite person then there would have be a tie between the two candidate yes those number seem large but in comparison to the number of voter that there be in those year they be a small fraction of they this show how close election be with the Electoral College

320,0,"Many problems that our world is facing right now are pointed back to car usage. Problems such as congestion, high levels of smog, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions in many places are all discussed in these articles.

These days people can't get see themselves going on with their life without a car but in places such as Bogota, Columbia they have a set date called ""The Day Without Cars"". The day without cars is a carfree day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.paragraph 20 Many people in Bogota choose to hike, bike, skate or take buses in order to get to work or wherever else they need to be. Some Colombians even enjoy it, such as businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" paragraph 24 In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" places such as Vauban, Germany are even giving up the usage of cars. vaughn's streets are completely ""carfree"". paragraph 2 A media trainer and mother of two in Vauban named Heidrun Walter described how the change to not using cars has affected her in a positive way when she said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" paragraph 3 Experts say that automobiles have a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. paragraph 5 When places like Vauban begin to reduce or completely end car usage, the greenhouse gas is also reduced and helps to reach the goal of a more healthy and clean society.

The article ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog,"" Talks about cities such as Paris that have tried to forcedly ban driving. The reason for doing this was in hope to ""clear the air of the global city."" paragraph 10 Even though there were many who did not participate in the ban of cars in Paris, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. paragraph 14 Not only did this effort of less car usgae reduce congestion but it also reduced the level of smog in the France.

For many people cars are just an excuse not to exercise. For example, someone might say ""Why should I walk when i can drive?"" or ""Why should I bike when I could take a taxi?"" People are so busy and caught up in work and being the best over everyone that exercise and physical condition are the least of their worries when really, it should be at the top of their list of importance. If someone decides to walk or skate to work everyday they would be in a healthy state of being and not have to worry or stress about finding extra time after work or school to exercise. If car usage is limited, our community would be drastically more healthy, physically and mentally.

The amount of car usage has a great affect on many things in our community and our world. Car usage affects not only the pollution in our living conditions but also our mood and for some people, their happiness and stress level. The limited amount of cars also forces us to seek different forms of transportation that are not all motorized. Without cars people sometimes choose to walk, bike, skate, or even run to where they need to be. Not only does this improve our pollution problem but it also improves our physical and mental health.

286,0,"Many countries are pushing towards less cars, ultimatelycreating a better world. By limiting car usage, drivers all around the world can limit greenhouse gas emissions that cause air pollution, take away some of the stress on young and old drivers concerning money and confidence at the wheel, and make cities become healthier, along with the people in them.

Stated in source 1:In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, passenger cars in Europe create 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to about 50 percent in the United States. These cars, primarily owned by the middle class, create an enormous amount of pollution. Paris had to ban half the cars from driving for a whole day because of the thick layer of smog that had developed Source 2:Paris bans driving due to smog. In fact there was almost as much smog as Beijing, which is known for being a very polluted city. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza believes a carfree day is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollutionSource 3:Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. In Source 4:The End of Car Culture, sociologist relay that transportation is the second largest source of America's emission.

Less cars would lower stress levels for all ages. In source 1, paragraph 3, a mother of two and media trainer, shares that with a car she was much tense. Now that she lives in a town where there are not as many cars, she is much happier. Paragraph 32, in source 4 shows why many Americans have stopped getting cars. Some are not in an economic position to buy them, so they use alternatives like biking and carpooling which are just as effective. In paragraph 35 of the same source, a sociology professor named Mimi Sheller informs that people can use the Internet to get many things instead of driving to a store. This factor also relieves stress on those not confident with their driving ability or unable to drive.

Not using cars as much has led to cities growing and becoming closer at the same time. In the city of Vauban, Germany, stores are placed closer so walking is quicker and healthier than taking an automobile paragraph 6, Source 1. Bogota has constructed 118 miles of bicycle paths in response to the positive feedback of carfree days thereSource 3, paragraph 27. The next paragraph shows how recreational settings have received a lot of business and the city has created new buildings. Paragraph 35 from source 4 tells how more desireable cities have brought more people in, creating a smaller need for cars to drive from suburb to city, and then back to the suburbs again. Bill Ford, the executive chairman for Ford, informs that all transportation methods save time, conserve resources, and lower emissions, in turn improving safetyParagraph 43, Source 4.

Less stress on people will propel production in work and other fields and more urbanized cities allows people to interact with each other even greater than in other settings.",0,"many country be push towards less car ultimatelycreate a well world by limit car usage driver all around the world can limit greenhouse gas emission that cause air pollution take away some of the stress on young and old driver concern money and confidence at the wheel and make city become healthy along with the people in they

1305,1,"Presidential elections are a big part of the American culture. They decide who will be president for the next 4 years, who will be the one making all the choices. But is our way of chosing that person right? We use electoral colleges to decide for president. Some people believe that we shouldn't have electoral colleges, and that we should let the peoples vote be the one to decide. But electoral colleges are a good way of deciding our future president for many reasons, it allows for a certainty of outcome, avoid runoff elections, and balance out the distribution of votes.

Electoral colleges will allow for a certainty of an outcome. The amount of electoral college votes are 538 this allows for us to see a clear difference in the votes for each party, as oppose to a people votes where you have hundreds of millions of people voting making it impossible to see a clear difference unless you have a blow out. The outcome of a tie is possible but according to the third source ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538is an even number, but it is highly unlikely..."" Also most states use a winnertakeall system where the majority of the votes in a state would win the electoral votes of that state providing a voice for the people. This this shows that having electoral votes decide the president is a good idea because it marks a clear winner.

Having electoral college votes will also allow us to avoid runoff elections. Runoff elections are when no part receives a majority of the votes. Electoral colleges help avoid that because of the fact that they are distributed evenly and mark a clear winner. ""Runoff elections add a huge amount of burden on the candidates, but some of the pressure is reduced by the electoral colleges"" states the third source.

The distribution of votes is balanced out evenly thanks to electoral colleges. If a state is larger then they will have more electoral votes than a smaller state. For example the third passage states that ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" This shows how the state that is larger in population gets more votes pleasing more people.

733,0,"If you were told on some days of the week that you are not allowed to drive your car to work, or even use your car at all, would you be glad or happy? Many people don't like it at first, but then grow to like the changes and outcome of not using your car as much, or not having a car. Some people say they are less stressed by not driving, or owning a car. Also people are happier that they are saving money. And they are helping the environment because it is not so polluted and smogged.

First off, when you have a car and drive it around all day, and sit in it all day, its stressful. When you are rushing yourself out the door in the morning so you're not late to work, and then you have to sit in traffic for 30 minutes or so just to get to work, is very stressful. Then on your way home from work is very stressful too. You are coming home in what is called ""rush hour"" where everyone is getting off work around the same time 5am and you just have to sit in more traffic every day! It is less stressful to not have a car, or use your car that much because you can then walk, or ride a bike. So its more relaxing and you get more time outside and excersizing. Also when you are not using your car, or do not own a car, you become more responsible and have a better track of time. So that just helps out with not being as stressed out!

Another reason why people like not driving or owning a car is that people are saving money. If you are not driving as much, then you dont need to go out and pay for gas as often. If you don't own a car at all, then you don't have to pay those monthly bills of owning that car, plus you don't have to pay for gas at all! Also by not driving as much or not owning a car does not tempt you to go out and spend the day at the mall, or always go out for lunch and dinner with friends. In todays society, many people want to save money. Many people try to save money, but don't know where to start or how to start. And with this way, just may be a helping hint to it.

With not driving as much, actually helps our planet and environment. It may not seem like it, but it does. Your not polluting the environment, and youre just being one more person to help make it a healthier environment and planet. If we had atleast 50 maybe 100 people from each city across America to not use their car 3 days a week, can make a big major difference in todays society in the multiple ways. It would help out in ways like not being as stressed, saving money, and helping our environment too.

There is many reasons as to why not driving as much or not owning a car can help out yourself, and the environment. Just by not driving as much or owning a car can make you a better person by not being as stressed out, you save lots of money by not driving so often or owning a car, and you are also helping our environment and planet by becoming a better and healthier place.",0,"if you be tell on some day of the week that you be not allow to drive your car to work or even use your car at all would you be glad or happy many people do n't like it at first but then grow to like the change and outcome of not use your car as much or not have a car some people say they be less stress by not drive or own a car also people be happy that they be save money and they be help the environment because it be not so polluted and smogge

980,1,"Dear State Senator, I do not like the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It's basically a winnertakeall system in each state. Especially with California it represents 35 million voters and if they are really close and have a tight margin the winning side of the votes takes it all, which means all the 55 representative votes go for that one side. getting rid of it would be fantastic because we could have other options on having a better vote system that is more accurate and fair to the the peoplevoters.

First of all, an example of this could be Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Like almost all cases award electoral votes on a winnertakeall, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state. the popular vote was very close in Florida nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.

Secondly, this is not the greatest way to vote because first the voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, which in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for the slate of 34 Democratic electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president which wouldn't be what the voters want in some cases.

Third, according to the Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Next election the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner couldagain lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. The Electoral college is not the best way to choose, it has minimum chances of succeeding in the future. I think a direct vote would work the best for the voters but yet the the electoral college has its cons.

Conclusively, the Electoral College is not the best way to vote. By a bare minimum margin of votes, it could cost the election for the other candidate. The bigger state could be a catastrophy and it would be unfair. Last, the Electoral College is irrational, outdated, and unfair for the most part with its winnertakesall.",0,"Dear State Senator I do not like the Electoral College the Electoral College be unfair outdated and irrational it be basically a winnertakeall system in each state especially with California it represent 35 million voter and if they be really close and have a tight margin the win side of the vote take it all which mean all the 55 representative vote go for that one side get rid of it would be fantastic because we could have other option on have a well vote system that be more accurate and fair to the the peoplevoter

650,0,"Nowadays, there is one sure thing we depend on to go from Point A to Point B: cars. Cars are used everywhere to drive to work, school, a park or wherever it may be. However, the total amount of automobiles moving out in the streets consumes up too much gas. This gas being released causes smog, or air pollution, that is harmful to our atmosphere & is one of the main causes of global warming. Next, the elimination of cars improves the safety of pedestrians and people wandering on the roads which has indeed prevented people from dying in countries like Colombia and France.

To begin with, when people are driving cars for whatever it may be, they are unintentionally harming the economy. This happens because cars run off of gasoline and when a car is accelerating, the gas is being burned by the motor engine which after is released into the air. Smog is produced being one of the top causes for global warming & this is an exceedingly problematic effect to the atmospherical being of humans and space. Moreover, Paris has reinforced a temporary driving ban due to these longterm, harmful effects to clear the air of the global city. If drivers refuse to obey, they would get fined 22 euros and up to 4,000 drivers were fined. They were blaming diesel fuel although, after five days of intensifying smog, congestion drastically dropped 60% competing against Beijing, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

In addition, the elimination of cars in the streets has benefited society in a way that it keeps people safe. As various countries around the world face the risk of car accidents, innocent deaths, lack of resources, and car commuting, they begin to enact laws to try & stop these risky, dangerous downfall from happening. In the suburbs located within Germany, residents of Vauban are pioneers doing what commuting executives have never done before: giving up their cars. This happens since street parking and driveways aren't allowed although the streets are ""carfree"", a couple are found at the edge of a community as well as the tram running down Freiburg. Plus, without an abundant amount of automobiles anymore, cities become more loose and flow therefore providing a better walking path.

To conclude, cars on the streets may be efficient for people to get to places easily and rapidly, but the substances it releases is harmful to the environment. Smog and air pollution are formed when cars drive greatly contributing to global warming, because they consume up too much gas. Furthermore, not only does it cause air pollution, but it also creates a possibility of putting people's lives in danger by the factors that might affect the consciousness of a driver. So the eliminating of cars does the community good both physically and economically like it is practiced in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota.",0,"nowadays there be one sure thing we depend on to go from Point A to point B car car be use everywhere to drive to work school a park or wherever it may be however the total amount of automobile move out in the street consume up too much gas this gas be release cause smog or air pollution that be harmful to our atmosphere be one of the main cause of global warming next the elimination of car improve the safety of pedestrian and people wander on the road which have indeed prevent people from die in country like Colombia and France

 to conclude car on the street may be efficient for people to get to place easily and rapidly but the substance it release be harmful to the environment Smog and air pollution be form when car drive greatly contribute to global warming because they consume up too much gas furthermore not only do it cause air pollution but it also create a possibility of put people 's life in danger by the factor that might affect the consciousness of a driver so the eliminating of car do the community good both physically and economically like it be practice in Vauban Paris and Bogota"
380,0,"Taking a deep breath in a city filled with cars and buses, people would be inhaling all the emissions giving off by the heavy duty use of cars. Taking in smog is like breathing in dirt. Changes around the world are taking place to accommodate to the impacts caused by cars. In the twentyfirst century, cars are a must to get from place to place. So, why is it that there is a decline in the buying of cars? Well, the less usage of cars creates no smog to inhale, would promote alternative transportation, and the culture in this society helps create less dependence on cars which leds to a better environment.

First things first, around the world something known as ""smart planning"" is taking place. This is a movement to separate suburban life from auto use. One main reason this movement is taking place is to reduce emissions giving off by automobiles, that would soon lead to smog. According to ""Paris ban driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer, which states,"" After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This ban was necessary due to the over pollution cars create and because of it, air was able to become breathable again. Moreover, in "" Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky, Bogota tells the goal behind the carfree day, which states, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Clearly, having a bus filled with residents is a better choice than having cars filled only by one or two passengers because one bus would not produce as much emissions than twenty cars.

furthermore, the less dependence of cars would promote alternative transportation. Having a city filled with people walking, riding bikes, and taking buses would allow a traffic free city. In Europe, cities are taking the step forward by creating a city where it is difficult to obtain a car. According to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, explains the main motive why cities are making it difficult to use cars, which is, ""Its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" This means, that by making it a struggle to obtain a car, it would help promote others to use public transportation or another method, which at the end of the day, would benefit the environment.

Last but not least, the culture of the world is constanly changing day by day. In the twentyfirst century, technology has taken over the lives of many. From apps to the internet, the changes are inevitable thanks to the breakthrough in technology. In ""The End of Car Culture,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University, explains,""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift."" Mimi is talking about the recent decline of automobile sales occuring which mean less and less people are buying cars. She believes the reason behind the decline is due to the culture in which involves technology. Moreover, she goes on to say,"" Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" Again and again technology proves to be a saving factor in this world to humans, and in this case it is saving humans from injurying the only home it has. With the easy access of calling someone up for a ride or searching up public transportation near by, allows the environment to be fresher and cleaner, as well as, it allows humans to interact with one another without having to drive to that person's house.

Movements take place to improve what seems to be a problem. It is obvious that the over usage of cars is a problematic case. Around the world, people are going around side by side, without depending on cars like they use to back a couple years ago. Improvements shown in places like Paris, shows how the limiting of automobile usage can greatly impact the environment to create a clean atmosphere. Not only would it help clear smog, but it would allow a stress free city from being populated by traffic jams and yelling individuals, who are experiencing road rage thanks to the taffic. A happier environment would be created when people are out rding bikes to places and walking with friends. In cocnclusion, the benifits of limiting car usage are as clear as water, it would reduce smog, promote other forms of transportation, and would help our culture by creating a happier, cleaner atmosphere to live in.",0,"take a deep breath in a city fill with car and bus people would be inhale all the emission give off by the heavy duty use of car take in smog be like breathe in dirt change around the world be take place to accommodate to the impact cause by car in the twentyfirst century car be a must to get from place to place so why be it that there be a decline in the buying of car well the less usage of car create no smog to inhale would promote alternative transportation and the culture in this society help create less dependence on car which led to a well environment

1506,0,"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages, both for individuals and for the environment. The passages provided highlight the benefits of car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days, all of which contribute to a more sustainable and efficient future.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and work towards a cleaner and healthier environment.

Car-free communities, such as Vauban in Germany, offer a model for a more sustainable way of living. These communities prioritize walking, cycling, and public transportation, and discourage car ownership. The passage states that 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. The residents of Vauban have experienced improved quality of life and reduced stress levels without cars. This suggests that limiting car usage can lead to a more peaceful and enjoyable community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. The passages highlight how driving bans, such as the one implemented in Paris, can significantly reduce congestion. In Paris, congestion decreased by 60 percent after the ban was enforced. This reduction in traffic congestion not only improves air quality but also saves time for commuters. With fewer cars on the road, public transportation becomes more efficient, allowing for faster travel times and a smoother flow of traffic.

In addition to these benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to healthier and more active communities. Car-free days, such as the one in Bogota, Colombia, encourage people to walk, bike, or use public transportation. These alternative modes of transportation promote physical activity, which is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The passage mentions how millions of Colombians participated in the car-free day and left the streets devoid of traffic jams. This shows that there is a willingness among people to embrace alternative modes of transportation and prioritize their health.

Overall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved quality of life, reduced traffic congestion, and healthier communities. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the success and feasibility of implementing car-free initiatives. As a society, it is important to prioritize sustainable transportation options and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars.",1,"limit car usage have numerous advantage both for individual and for the environment the passage provide highlight the benefit of car free community drive ban and car free day all of which contribute to a more sustainable and efficient future

2045,0,"Title: The Uprising of Car-Reduced Communities: A Sustainable Pathway

The increasing sociological shift towards the creation of car-reduced communities highlights the importance of reevaluating our dependency on automobiles. Despite a longstanding global culture entrenched with car dependency, numerous cities across the globe are pioneering this change through deliberate and smart planning. Examples from locations as diverse as Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, Bogota, Colombia, and even various locations in the United States provide compelling evidence of the benefits of such transformation.

Vauban, a German suburb on the outskirts of Freiburg, serves as a vibrant example of a suburb where car usage is minimized (Rosenthal, Passage 1). Visible benefits include the creation of safer streets characterized by decreased noise, lower levels of tension, and enhanced social interaction (Rosenthal, Passage 1). More importantly, the reduction in car usage has positive implications for the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a primary contributor to climate change (Rosenthal, Passage 1).

Similarly, Paris in France adopted a car limitation strategy in response to growing concerns about smog levels that, shockingly, rivaled those of heavily polluted Beijing, China (Duffer). The resultant decrease in congestion by 60% showed immediate improvements in the air quality within the city, thereby improving the health and quality of life of its citizens (Duffer).

Across the Atlantic, Bogota, Colombia, underwent an annual ""Day Without Cars"" initiative, which not only reduced smog but also encouraged alternative modes of transportation and a stronger sense of community (Selsky). This initiative was part of a broader campaign that included the construction of more bicycle paths and upgrading infrastructure, thus making it a safer and more desirable place to live (Selsky).

A surprising trend is underway in the United States where, traditionally, automobile usage has been widespread due to its expansive territory and suburban ideals (Rosenthal, Passage 4). As America’s love for cars appears to be cooling, alternative solutions are arising: flexible commuting, telecommuting, bicycling, carpooling, car sharing, public transportation, and even walking (Rosenthal, Passage 4).

Not only does the transition to a car-reduced community improve the environment and health of its citizens, but it also contributes towards a sustainable future. The younger generation seems more inclined towards this direction, making it both beneficial and practical to continue this trend. Car companies like Ford and Mercedes are already adjusting their business models to adapt to this cultural shift, emphasizing 'mobility' over personal car ownership (Rosenthal, Passage 4).

In conclusion, shifting our societal outlook from a car-dependent culture to one of car-reduced communities can have multifaceted benefits including improving our wellbeing, strengthening community bonds, reducing pollution, and contributing to the preservation of our planet. Recognizing and accepting such a shift is a progressive step, one that not only benefits us but also ensures a better and healthier environment for future generations. As more and more cities worldwide adopt this approach, it brings us closer to a more sustainable and healthier lifestyle, thus making a significant stride for both societal and environmental sustainability.",1,"title the Uprising of Car reduce Communities a sustainable Pathway

1350,0,"You're running late for work, but you still have to drop the kids off at work. Or maybe you overslept and have to get to school soon. You get everything ready for the day, jump into your car, and you drive off. Cars are very important in todays society, but limiting your car usage can have its advantages. Reducing the amount of times you use your car could help the environment, the economy, and the development of the city you are living in.

Pollution is a topic that is heard of everywhere, yet we don't take action to prevent it. Limiting your car usage could help contribute to helping the world get rid of pollution in the air. Paris typically has mor smog than other European capitals due to their usage of diesel fuel. Diesels make up about 67 percent of vehicles in France. Paris has tried to stop people from using their cars so much and is fining them if they are. Eventually, due to so much smog and diesel usage, people will have to stop using their cars so much if they want to be abe to see where they're going when driving.

The economy will benefit from the limited usage of cars. Think about it, if we use our cars less, we don't run out of gas as fast as we usually would. If we don't run out of gas, we don't spend as much money trying to fill the tank. If we don't buy as much gas, the price of gas will decrease due to the amount the pipelines are able to store and generate at the same time. If we limit our usage of vehicles, insurance costs will decrease because people are not driving as often and there aren't as many accidents happening.

The development of the city you live in will change in a good way for you if you limit the usage of your vehicles. It used to be that people in the old days wanted to move out as far as possible from their neighbors for ""space"". The areas and cities just kept on expanding an dit would take longer to get somewhere in town. People wanted to live in suburban and have a job in the city. This increased the usage of cars and other vehicles. Now, people are starting to move back into the city, amking it denser. Once you live in the city, you wouldn't have to use your car to go grocery shopping because there is a public or walmart right across the street from you. People in these dense cities will start to walk or ride their bikes to work.

Parents wouldn't have to worry about being late and still having to drop of their kids. While the parent is able to drive twice toandfrom work, the kids could go toandfrom school by walkin or riding their bikes. This cuts off the usage off the car. Instead of dropping of the kids and then going to work and then going to pick the kids up and then head home, know you won't have to do that.

Limiting the amount of time you use your car for can help the world and yourself. You save money, time, and the planet all at once by using your vehicles less. On the outskirts of Freiburg, Germany, residents in a community are forbidden of street parking, driveways, and home garages. Car ownership is allowed, but you would have to park in a large garage at the edge of the development. Along with this, you eould pay 40,000, with a home, to be a car owner. These methods are being used more and more to stop the great and unreasonable usage of cars.",0,"you be run late for work but you still have to drop the kid off at work or maybe you overslept and have to get to school soon you get everything ready for the day jump into your car and you drive off car be very important in today society but limit your car usage can have its advantage reduce the amount of time you use your car could help the environment the economy and the development of the city you be live in

662,0,"A day without driving your car? who can't do that. Also making the Earth a better place to live? awesome! Taking advantage of a limiting car using its a great idea because people are lowering air pollution and there's no more rushhour. Getting stuck in traffic isn't pretty nice and most likely if you have a meeting your going to be late. Also people just dont want to own cars anymore.

To start off, I like the idea that people are limiting their car usage because people are lowering air pollution. In source 2, the author explains ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog.. rivaled in Beijing, China, Which is known as one of the most polluted cites in the world."" This means that cars are bad for the environment they had to decrease the number of cars so they could stop the smog because they didn't wanted to end up like china. But however, not using cars is affecting car industry like it states in source 4 ""since ttransportation is the second larges source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implication for the car industry."" Never the less, air pollution is the main problem like in source 3 in Bogota ""The goal is to promote alternative ttransportation and reduce smog."" The reason they are doing this is for people to find another way to get to their destination and to reduce smog as it states.

Furthermore, I like the idea that people are limiting their car usage because there's no more rushhour. avoiding traffic is great like in source 3 "" Bogota, Colombia In a program that's spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or tok buses to work during a carfree day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic."" colombians do this to avoid traffic and its a cool way because you could ride bikes and skated. likewise in source 4 some Children don't get their driver license its not because they're lazy it's because they don't need them, yeah they come in handy but they're not interseted for example in source 4 they stated ""They organized their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" having a car isn't a teenager main interest, they rather walk to a close by place or car pool with their friends.

To sum up, in my opinion I think limiting car usage is a great idea because less air pollution, rushhour, and some people just don't want to own cars.",0,"a day without drive your car who ca n't do that also make the Earth a well place to live awesome take advantage of a limit car use its a great idea because people be lower air pollution and there be no more rushhour get stuck in traffic be n't pretty nice and most likely if you have a meeting your go to be late also people just do nt want to own car anymore

371,1,"Americans throughout the country believe that the Electoral College isn't fair and believe that they deserve a more direct voting system to the president, other than voting for electors. These reasons are made by the people because they want more and more power in the government. What the people want is almost always the risky option, especially when the topic is government. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept as the way it is now, and not a direct voting systemm for American citizens.

As said in the previous statement, Americans that want the Electoral College gone are lurking for more power when it comes to rules. Unfortunately, if the government's decisions were left in the hands of the people, the country's state would be in anarchy. On the other hand, the electoral college offers Congress and the Senate a share of the power, and the American citizens a share of the power as well. For example, if the Electoral College began to diminish, then became wiped out immediately, the government could do nothing less but to watch as the people choose the president that they want. Sometimes, what is wanted by the people may not always be the right thing.

Moving on, almost 60 percent of all American voters stated that they would rather have a direct voting systemm, putting aside the Electoral College. What most people are not seeing is that the direct voting and Electoral College systemm are very similar. The difference between the two is, that when Americans vote in the Electoral College, they are voting for electors that go towards the president, and when Americans vote directly to the president, those same amount of votes go to the president as well. If the voting systemm was based off of a direct route to the presidents side, then there would be too many votes to count, which is why have representatives towards each state is one of the glories of the Electoral College.

Finally, the popular voting systemm is very flawed, considering that there are states that have millions more people people than others. Some states even double the size of other states according to population. For example, New York's population most likely doubles the population of Florida's, but thanks to the Electoral College, the representative and population ratio weighs out, giving each state an equal amount of votes toward their president. Now, if the popular voting systemm was in place, then states like New York would outnumber states like Florida's votes by millions. It would not be as fair as it is now if the popular voting systemm replaced the Electoral College.

In conclusion, the Electoral college has many positive outlook like keeping the voting systemm fair and not giving too much power to either side when voting is the subject. Although many Americans believe that the electoral College is causing the wrong presidents to win, it does not make a difference either way because of the way that the Electoral College evens out the votes.",0,"american throughout the country believe that the Electoral College be n't fair and believe that they deserve a more direct voting system to the president other than vote for elector these reason be make by the people because they want more and more power in the government what the people want be almost always the risky option especially when the topic be government I believe that the Electoral College should be keep as the way it be now and not a direct voting systemm for american citizen

674,1,"""The electoral college is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between electionn of the President by a vote in Congress and electionn of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The Electoral College is one of the most fair systems our society has set up. This process is fair and essential because it is is not the only determination, each state gets the correct amount of power, and it shows a clear winner.

The Electoral College does is not fully responsible for the outcome of the decision for our President. In the year 2000, this was proved, Gore had received more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes. ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" The section of the nation that believes the Electoral College is unfair believes this because they assume all the power is in this system's hands. Yet they are mistaken because clearly our popular vote can override this system if necessary. Though it is very rare most will argue, the fact that it is possible to not allow the Electoral College to take control of our government proves that the power is really all in the hands of the citizens. Clearly, the ""unfair"" picture most perceive is largely mistaken.

The sizes of states in our country widely varies. From Rhode Island to Texas, we have power in Congress. It would simply not be fair if our small states had the same amout of power as our larger states. California has more of a population, therefore should have more say in Congress, than New Jersey. ""Your states entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators."" Just the way this is set up in Congress, the same amount of power for each state is applied for choosing our President for the next four years. This is only fair to the population of America and equal representation in all the sections of congress would be unfair to the larger states that obviously require and deserve more power than the smaller states in the United States. Basically, power is fairly given to each state under the Electoral College.

""The Electoral College avoids the problem of electionns in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" Though this situation is rare, in 1968 when Nixon ran against Clinton, both had a total of 43 percent of the popular votes. Yet, because of the Electoral College, a clear winner was shown. If ever in case of this event, this ""pressure"" can complicate and make the choosing of the President way more difficult than it was planned to be. For this reason, our Electoral College sets up a way to take care of this if it was to happen again. Obviously, the Electoral College shows a clear winner and takes out any confusion or problems that could arise.

To conclude, our country is based off of fair rules and systems, one of them being the Electoral College. It is fair because it does not have full power, the right amount of power is applied to each state, and it produces a clear winner. ""Voters in presidential electionns are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.",0,"the electoral college be a process not a place the found father establish it in the Constitution as a compromise between electionn of the President by a vote in Congress and electionn of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizen the Electoral College be one of the most fair system our society have set up this process be fair and essential because it be be not the only determination each state get the correct amount of power and it show a clear winner

472,1,"The Electoral College is a easy, yet hard way of a candidate becomingthe President of the United States. The Electoral college was created by how ever many majority of the electoral votes will become the new president. This brings many issues within the U.S.. The popularity vote does not matter in a situation like this and is not likely relied on to decide who the president will be. The Electoral College is not right, it'sunfair, and is very controversial. The argument though is that withthe Electoral College the votes which are dominant have a better chance of the two nominees not having the same amount of votes rather than if it was relied on by the popularity votes. This still though does not resolve nor question that the Electoral College needs to be replaced.

Initially, the Electoral College is not right at all. The electoral votes in the U.S. combined throughout all the states equals 538votes. Popularity votes which are votes that have an advantage of the election are more than tens of thousands if not more. This is an example on how the Electoral College works. An example of this is in the source by ""Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" it states, "" Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 42 percent of the popularity vote but won through the electoral votes because they had bigger states voting for them making them win that election"". This shows how the Electoral College is not right and should reverse the value of electoral and popularity votingPoshner, 22.

Additionally, the Electoral College votingis very unfair because many sources giving have shown to people that many candidateshave had less popularity vote but have won through the majority of the electoral votes. This is unfair because popularity votes mean popularity votes which are votes that are of the majority of all votes. Unfortunately, the popularity votes do not count. As said in the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states, "" if you wanted to vote for John Kerry and you lived in Texas the vote would go to 34 Democratic electors that pledged to Kerry"". This is why popularity vote should be the deciding factor of who becomes the next President. If every election would be based on popularity vote the candidate won each of those elections would probably all change due to the fact that so many elections have won based on electoral votePlumer,10.

To end with, the Electoral College is so controversial. Out of more than two hundredyears of elections many have been close and many have been a mile away from each other. The electoral vote decides it all though. The main problem with this process is how it is setup. The electoral vote is dominent over the popular vote, but it shouldnt be. The electoral vote has made bad decisions yet good decisions throughout the hundreds of years its been around and the main reasin for electoral votes are to keep the candidates running not havethe same number of votes so that they won't have to have another election and voting cast. ""It is also really controversial since the voting also might rely on the political party that the candidate is running for"", as stated by ""What is the Electoral College"". This Electoral College seems to go by how big the state is, the bigger the state themore electoralvotes that state has the smaller the state the less electoral votes that that state hasFederal Register, 5.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is unaccurate, lazy, unreasonable, yet successful. This process by many sources of evidence have concluded that there are in fact many holesin this system.

1562,0,"Limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the dependency on cars, communities can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote more sustainable and healthier lifestyles.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to studies mentioned in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, communities can make a substantial impact in reducing these emissions. For example, the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited and streets are car-free, has significantly lower emissions compared to car-intensive areas. This demonstrates that smart planning and reducing car usage can lead to a decrease in environmental pollution.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage has various health benefits. Cars are a major source of air pollution, which contributes to respiratory problems and other health issues. By promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, biking, or taking public transit, communities can improve air quality and reduce the health risks associated with pollution. The car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, for instance, resulted in a significant decrease in traffic congestion and promoted alternative modes of transportation, leading to cleaner air and a healthier city.

Moreover, limiting car usage can help create more accessible and walkable communities. Many suburbs are designed for car dependency, with stores located in malls along distant highways. However, adopting a new approach like Vauban, where stores are placed on a main street within walking distance, allows for more compact and accessible communities. This reduces the need for long car trips and encourages individuals to use alternative forms of transportation. Not only does this create a more connected and vibrant community, but it also reduces traffic congestion and the need for excessive parking spaces.

While some may argue that limiting car usage could inconvenience individuals or businesses, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Delivery companies may experience temporary setbacks, but the long-term benefits of cleaner air and reduced emissions are invaluable. Additionally, public transport options can be expanded to serve suburbs, making it more convenient for individuals to travel without cars. Awareness campaigns, like the car-free day in Bogota, can also help change attitudes and encourage individuals to embrace alternative modes of transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage provides numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. By reducing dependency on cars, communities can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote more sustainable and healthier lifestyles. Creating car-free or car-reduced communities, like Vauban in Germany, can serve as examples for the rest of the world to adopt smart planning strategies. While there may be some initial inconveniences, the long-term benefits of limiting car usage far outweigh any potential drawbacks. It is time to shift our focus from car-centered communities and embrace a more sustainable and healthier future.",1,"limit car usage can provide numerous advantage for both individual and the environment by reduce the dependency on car community can improve air quality reduce greenhouse gas emission and promote more sustainable and healthy lifestyle

1345,1,"Dear State Senator, I send you this letter to bring up an issue that is often debated amongst us Americans. Should we kee the Electoral College? No! The electoral college just doesn't work anymore and we have seen that in the past. You probably ask yourself what is wrong with the Electoral College? The problem with the Electoral College is that it is unfair, it doesn't rely on what the people say and it can sometimes really make the public mad.

The Electoral College is really unfair, especially for voters. We vote for who WE want, not for some other guy to say what we want. Voters want THEIR voice to be heard when they vote not someone else's. When we vote for a presidential candidate we want to vote directly for who we are voting, we want to pick who we want directly. In source 2 the article explains how the Electoral College works. The author says ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What this means is that when you voted for Obama you didn't vote for Obama , you voted for a group of people to vote for who they wanted. So your voice was not heard. Don't you find that unfair to the voters and to the candidates?

overtime one person votes for a certain presidential candidate, they are basically ignored. The President should be chosen by the people! And at the moment the President is being chosen by politicians who will ""represent"" us and repeat what we say although that has been proven to not always be true. Passage 2 reminds us of the incidence in the 2000 election in which Al Gore lost the presidency to George W. Bush by electoral votes, even though he had more individual votes. This proves that our state representatives will not always represent us how we want them to, but how they want to represent us. This is the reason why voters need a direct voice from them to picking their leaders. We should pick what we want not what some politicians want. You are probably saying that these incidents do not happen very often, as said in source 3. The article says ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000...but that was the first time since 1888"" This says that situations like this are very rare, yet it is still possible. Even so, wouldn't you rather the people be heard rather than a politician that claims to represent his state?

So many people got mad in 2000 when they just chose the president most people didn't want. There's many ways to make us Americans mad and this is just another one of those ways. In the United States you are supposed to be able to choose what you believe to be right. If you want to choose what you think should be the future's right president then you should be able to pick him and not have to expect anyone's approval or opinion on your vote. You should be able to walk out from the voting center and say I voted for this guy. Eventually keeping the Electoral College will only cause more problems, because as time goes on the human develops its opinion futher and creates and spreads new ideas meaning that there will be more people picking different things. If you think that what you are picking should be picked you should be able to say ""I want that"" and not have to through the bother knowing that a politician may have chosen what you DON'T want. If you want to make Americans mad, then keep the Electoral College.

In conclusion I think that the Electoral College be removed and the use of popular vote be put into effect because the Electoral College is unfair, it does not reply on what the public says and it makes the Americans mad. Please take this letter into consideration.",0,"Dear State Senator I send you this letter to bring up an issue that be often debate amongst us Americans should we kee the Electoral College no the electoral college just do n't work anymore and we have see that in the past you probably ask yourself what be wrong with the Electoral College the problem with the Electoral College be that it be unfair it do n't rely on what the people say and it can sometimes really make the public mad

Subject: Keeping or Changing the Electoral College for Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping it or changing to an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Our current system remains a topic of debate, and I believe it is essential for us to consider the arguments from various perspectives before making any decisions.

The Office of the Federal Register describes the Electoral College as a compromise between election of the President by Congress and election of the President by a popular vote (""What Is the Electoral College?""). Proponents of the Electoral College argue that it ensures a certain degree of certainty of outcome, preventing disputes over the popular vote (Posner 18). Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that a presidential candidate needs to have trans-regional appeal and prevents regional favorites from neglecting the interests of residents from other regions (Posner 19). 

Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, leading to a more informed electorate and fostering thoughtful voters (Posner 20). It also helps to maintain a balance of political power between large and small states, restoring some weight to the political influence of larger states, which can affect policy outcomes (Posner 21). Finally, the Electoral College mitigates the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, ensuring a clear winner (Posner 22).

However, critics argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic and unfair to voters. They point out flaws in the system, such as the possibility of a candidate winning the electoral vote while losing the popular vote (Plumer 10). Some people argue that the winner-take-all system deters candidates from campaigning in states they know they have no chance of winning, leading to a lack of attention to certain regions during the campaign (Plumer 13). Furthermore, they believe that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters in states dominated by one political party (Plumer 13). 

While these criticisms hold merit, it is worth noting that the Electoral College has only produced such a outcome in a few instances throughout history (Plumer 16). Additionally, voter turnout in elections suggests that voters are motivated by the desire to express their political preference, rather than by the expectation of a single vote having a decisive impact on the election (Posner 23).

As we evaluate the arguments both for and against the Electoral College, it is important to prioritize a system that upholds democratic principles while addressing the concerns raised by its critics. One possible compromise could be to explore a proportional allocation of electors rather than a winner-take-all system, as practiced by Maine and Nebraska (Office of the Federal Register 7). This approach could strike a balance between ensuring regional representation and promoting fairness in the allocation of electoral votes. 

In conclusion, the issue of whether to keep or change the Electoral College for presidential elections is a complex one. While the system may have its flaws, it also provides certain benefits that contribute to a balanced democracy. I urge you to carefully consider all perspectives and propose solutions that maintain fairness and democratic principles while addressing the concerns of those who criticize the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter. I trust that you will make decisions that serve the best interests of our state and our nation. I look forward to hearing your response.

 while these criticism hold merit it be worth note that the Electoral College have only produce such a outcome in a few instance throughout history Plumer 16 additionally voter turnout in election suggest that voter be motivate by the desire to express their political preference rather than by the expectation of a single vote have a decisive impact on the election posner 23 

 as we evaluate the argument both for and against the Electoral College it be important to prioritize a system that uphold democratic principle while address the concern raise by its critic one possible compromise could be to explore a proportional allocation of elector rather than a winner take all system as practice by Maine and Nebraska Office of the Federal Register 7 this approach could strike a balance between ensure regional representation and promote fairness in the allocation of electoral vote 

 in conclusion the issue of whether to keep or change the Electoral College for presidential election be a complex one while the system may have its flaw it also provide certain benefit that contribute to a balanced democracy I urge you to carefully consider all perspective and propose solution that maintain fairness and democratic principle while address the concern of those who criticize the Electoral College 

 thank you for your time and attention to this important matter I trust that you will make decision that serve the good interest of our state and our nation I look forward to hear your response

652,1,"If I were to choose between keeping the electoral college or abolishing it, I would chose for abolishing it. The electoral college has a system that can be considered confusing to most americans. This system indirectly transfers citizen's votes to congress. This allows for loopholes and sabotage to be commited during the process of electing a president.

Back in 1960. segregationalists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.

source 2, second paragraph.

This is stating that in 1960 people who opposed Kennedy nearly became his electors. So if they succeeded in becoming his electors his votes would have gone to another opposing candidate. This could not happen with a system of voting that directly connected everyones votes with congress. This was a clear case of sabotage in the election of 1960.

Votes in larger states and smaller states are balanced out so the number of votes would not be based on the number of people in the states. This can be seen as a way to make sure that state votes did not compare to the population of said states. In reality it is limiting the votes of citizens. If people ignored how larger states had more people than smaller states and just thought of everyone as individuals everyone would have a say. The system I am proposing does not view states as the voters, but every american citizen as one. After everyone passed their votes, they would all be tallied and which ever candidate had the most votes would win.

You may think that the votes could be sabotaged, and that politicians could put in fake votes and get rid of real ones. This problem could be dealt with by maximized security. There would be videocameras wherever the votes could be swaped.

I propose this system to ensure that every citizen has a vote, and that corruption while transitioning the votes would be eliminated.

1413,0,"In an era marked by heightened environmental consciousness and the pursuit of sustainable living, the notion of limiting car usage emerges as a potent catalyst for positive change. Drawing insights from a diverse array of sources, it becomes apparent that reducing dependence on personal vehicles not only addresses ecological concerns but also promises to reshape urban landscapes and improve the overall quality of life.

At the forefront of the argument for limiting car usage is the imperative to safeguard the environment. According to findings from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the emissions from automobiles contribute significantly to air pollution and climate change. Opting for alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or bicycles, offers a tangible means for individuals to mitigate their environmental impact. This shift is not merely a lifestyle adjustment; it is a collective step toward fostering a sustainable planet for current and future generations.

Beyond the ecological sphere, the limitations of car usage offer a compelling solution to the persistent problem of urban congestion, as highlighted by the Urban Land Institute. The ever-growing reliance on personal vehicles results in congested roadways, longer commute times, and heightened stress levels for urban residents. The remedy, as proposed by the Institute, lies in the strategic development of alternative transportation infrastructure. Robust public transit systems, pedestrian-friendly zones, and dedicated cycling lanes are not just urban planning nuances; they represent a vision for cities where mobility is seamless, and the urban experience is marked by accessibility and efficiency.

Moreover, the advantages of limiting car usage extend to personal health, a perspective underscored by the World Health Organization (WHO). The sedentary lifestyle associated with prolonged car use is recognized as a significant risk factor for health issues, including obesity and cardiovascular diseases. WHO advocates for a shift towards active transportation, such as walking or cycling, not only as a means of improving individual health but also as a way to cultivate vibrant communities. Streets, in this vision, are not mere conduits for traffic but become shared spaces that encourage physical activity and social interaction.

While the benefits of limiting car usage are clear, the path forward is not without its challenges. Infrastructure development, policy adjustments, and community engagement are essential components, as highlighted by experts in urban planning and public health. Local authorities and citizens alike must collaborate to create environments that seamlessly accommodate alternative transportation methods, ensuring that the shift is not only feasible but also convenient and safe.

In conclusion, the call to limit car usage resonates as a powerful and multifaceted strategy, encompassing environmental stewardship, urban planning innovation, and public health promotion. By heeding the insights from the EPA, Urban Land Institute, and WHO, citizens can actively contribute to a paradigm shift towards a more sustainable and harmonious future.

331,1,"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is a system that the United States has been using to elect its leaders for many years. A large number of people have come to believe that this method of voting is fraud because not everyone's vote is truly heard. The way the Electoral College works is every four years when people go to vote, people are not actually voting directly for their desired leader, but for a state elector. Although this sounds like it would work flawlessly in theory, in some cases the number of electoral votes have overridden the number of popular votes.

In the 2000 election between Bush and Gore, Bush ended up winning even though Gore received more popular votes. The nation did not know who the President was going to be until the next year because the election came down to only a couple of hundred votes. Although this is a rare occurance it shows how easily the Electoral College can wrongly choose a President. If the United States elected a President by taking a popular vote, this issue would not exist. All of the extra systems that are put in place are simply not needed.

If the Electoral College was removed and the United States voted in leaders based on the national popular vote, this means that there would also be more people voting. Many people, especially in one sided states such as Texas and California, believe that their vote does not count because they're state is guarenteed to favor one party every election. If the Electoral College did not exist then knowing that every individual vote counts and that it does not matter where you live, more people are actually going to listen to what candidates have to say and are going to go out and vote.

In Conclusion, although the Electoral College may sound good in theory, I believe that the United States voting system would be more legitimate if a national popular vote was taken so that everyone's voice is heard no matter where they live. Voters should be able to know that they're vote will count so that the right leader is chosen for the right reason.",0,"Dear State Senator the Electoral College be a system that the United States have be use to elect its leader for many year a large number of people have come to believe that this method of voting be fraud because not everyone 's vote be truly hear the way the Electoral College work be every four year when people go to vote people be not actually vote directly for their desire leader but for a state elector although this sound like it would work flawlessly in theory in some case the number of electoral vote have overridden the number of popular vote

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and to advocate for its preservation for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue in favor of changing to a system of election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides several crucial benefits that should be considered.

Firstly, the Electoral College system guarantees the certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, which has the potential for disputes and claims of tampering, the Electoral College results are more definitive. As seen in the 2012 election, President Obama received a significant majority of the electoral vote compared to his share of the popular vote. With the winner-take-all system in place, each state's indivisible electoral votes create a clear winner and reduce the likelihood of a tie. This certitude ensures a smooth and decisive election process.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters a sense of representation for all regions and states. A candidate must have trans-regional appeal and cannot solely rely on regional favoritism to win the presidency. This requirement encourages candidates to campaign across the nation and listen to the concerns and interests of voters from different regions. By ensuring that no single region has enough electoral votes to guarantee a win, the Electoral College promotes a more balanced representation for all areas of the country.

The system also incentivizes candidates to pay attention to swing states. While critics argue that this leads to campaigns focusing solely on these states, the fact remains that swing states receive the most attention and information from candidates. Voters in these states become more engaged and thoughtful in evaluating the candidates' policies and promises, knowing that their votes will play a crucial role in deciding the election. This engagement and informed decision-making should be considered valuable aspects of the Electoral College system.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a balance to the political weight of large states. In a popular vote system, candidates would likely concentrate their efforts on densely populated areas with larger voter bases. However, with the Electoral College, states of different sizes and populations are represented more equally. This ensures that candidates must consider the interests of both large and small states during their campaigns, preventing the neglect of smaller states' concerns.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This situation can lead to prolonged and complicated election processes. The Electoral College, on the other hand, consistently produces a clear winner, reducing the strain on the electoral system and providing a smoother transition to the next administration.

While critics claim that the Electoral College undermines the importance of individual votes and discourages participation, the data suggests otherwise. Participation rates in presidential elections remain high, with approximately half of the eligible population casting their votes. Voters are motivated to express their political preferences, rather than merely relying on the belief that a single vote could decide the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers essential benefits that should not be overlooked. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes nationwide representation, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of large states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. These advantages support the preservation of the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States.

I respectfully urge you to consider these points when evaluating any proposals to change the current system. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Dear [Senator's Name],

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system as the method for choosing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic process and offers significant benefits.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the presidential elections. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, ""The Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" the winner of the Electoral College typically receives a higher share of the electoral vote compared to their share of the popular vote. This provides a clear mandate for the elected president and reduces the likelihood of disputes or uncertainty surrounding the election results.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it fosters the notion of ""everyone's president."" With its requirement of trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents candidates from focusing solely on winning particular regions. This ensures that the elected president represents the interests of the entire nation, rather than just a few populous areas. By avoiding a situation where candidates can win the presidency by appealing only to specific regions, the Electoral College promotes the well-rounded leadership that our country needs.

Moreover, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. In his article, Judge Posner explains that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign in toss-up states, where the outcome is uncertain. This forces candidates to listen to and engage with voters in these states, making them more thoughtful and informed voters. By giving swing states a significant role in deciding the election, the Electoral College ensures that the concerns and priorities of these crucial states are addressed.

Furthermore, the Electoral College allows for the inclusion of larger states in the presidential election process. As Judge Posner points out, the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution means that larger states lose weight in terms of political balance. The Electoral College helps to balance this by providing a mechanism for larger states to receive more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account, promoting a more inclusive democracy.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. With its winner-take-all approach, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner without the need for further rounds of voting. This eliminates the complexity and potential complications that may arise from run-off elections and allows for a smooth and efficient presidential election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democracy. It ensures the certainty of outcome, fosters a president for everyone, encourages attention to swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While the system is not perfect, it offers significant advantages over a direct popular vote. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system as it plays a vital role in our democratic process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the information presented in this letter when formulating your stance on this issue.

347,1,"The process of chosing a president should be changed to popular vote instead of the electoral college. I say this because it is a better opportunity for the guy who has the most votes to win. Having the votes by popular votes can make it easier for the election of the president. also the electoral votes can really mess up how the election is taking place. it can make them mess up there counting of the votes or how the votes go through.

The electoral college can make a hard impact on how the voting process begins with. The electoral college can confuse the voter by making them chose the wrong person. In the text ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" the author is stating margin 10 lines 1113 that "" do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" this is showing how just using the electoral college can easily confuse those who are voting. Also in many occouins occurred when the electoral college didnt suceesed right. in the passage "" The indefensible Electoral College"" the author states in margin 11 lines 24 that "" The american people should consider themselves lucky that 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse.""

The electoral college is not consider a democratic system. thats why many people go against it because its not equaly fair to those who are democratic. IN the passage "" In Defense of the Electoral College"" the writer states in margin 15 and in lines 45 that "" the advocates of this position is correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense..."" This is showing that not all of it is fairly equal. So instead of using the electoral college it is a better method to go with popular vote because it a simpler way to do it. Establishing this will rapidly take on more votes then it would be a close race against both of the presidents. Chosing a president with the Electoral College can make the delectation go bad, so thats why having people vote who they want would be a more fair chance for those who are voting.

It comes out that the Electoral College is a siginficient way to do a vote on. the more imporant way to do a voting should be a popular vote because it gives the presidents a better chance to have the elecations on a good pace. instead of many votes go through then have to be checked on by state.

748,1,"Dear state senator, I'm writing to you today regarding my concerns on our voting method for the president of the United States. Although we've been voting by the electoral college for how ever many years, I don't think it is the most efficient and fair way of voting. Our Chamber of Commerce, former vice president Richard Nixon and many more would have to agree with me when I say that abolishing the electoral college could only be beneficial to us. The electoral college system is unfair, confusing and forces people to compromise.

The electoral college is unfair, being that voters don't always control who their electors vote for, opposed to election by popular vote. One reason why America strives is the fact that we are a democracy, where every one gets a say and we are not ruled by a dictators or communist. The electoral college in no way follows our democratic system, the people are not voting for our president our electors are the ones voting for us.

Not only is the electoral college unfair but it is also confusing. For new voters they may be confused by the electoral college. New voters may wonder why can't I just vote for the candidate I most prefer. Think about it like this, in the electoral college the electors are the middle man. Why not cut the middle man out? And as a result make the voting system much simpler.

People may agrue that the electoral college system stops a majority vote. So let's say, you're a democrat living in the state of Texas with the electoral college system in place. You might as well not vote for an elector cause the majority of the people in texas are going to vote for the republican elector. On the other hand, there is the election by popular vote, gives everyone a say in whom they'd like to vote for. There is always the possibility of the disater factor.

After sharing my concerns with you state senator, I hope you understand where I am coming from.",0,"dear state senator I be write to you today regard my concern on our voting method for the president of the United States although we have be vote by the electoral college for how ever many year I do n't think it be the most efficient and fair way of voting our Chamber of Commerce former vice president Richard Nixon and many more would have to agree with I when I say that abolish the electoral college could only be beneficial to we the electoral college system be unfair confusing and force people to compromise

I am writing to you as a concerned constituent in favor of maintaining the Electoral College system as outlined in the Constitution.

Judge Richard A. Posner, in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College"", provides compelling justifications for the importance of the Electoral College system. His argument in favor of the ""certainty of the outcome"" is particularly noteworthy. Although there is possibility exists of disputes over the electoral vote, this system is considerably less contentious than that of the popular vote because a candidate’s share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This not only assures a clear line of succession, but it also minimizes the likelihood of endless debates on the legitimacy of the President, which can divide the country.

Posner also highlights the valuable requirement for a presidential candidate to have cross-regional appeal, which ultimately serves the diverse nature of the U.S. By mandating no one region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, it ensures that all regions’ interests are considered during a campaign and tempers the potential for feelings of disenfranchisement as the president’s policies should ideally cater to a wide section of the population.

Simultaneously, it is paramount to address the concerns portrayed by Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College"". Plumer argues that the electoral college system is flawed, asserting ""it's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" He also emphasizes the potential of state legislatures overriding the will of the people and electors acting in faithlessness, amongst other issues. However, while we must recognize these risks, it's key to acknowledge the infrequency of such instances and the checks and balances in place that generally guide electors to vote in line with their state's chosen candidate. 

In conclusion, while the Electoral College system might not be perfect, it has key advantages that are valuable to the current reality of the United States' political landscape, namely ensuring broad geographic representation, providing a more definitive outcome, and avoiding the complexity of run-off elections (Posner). We need to focus our efforts on making the current system more resilient to abuses and educating the electorate on how the system works rather than transitioning to a new system that might have its own set of unforeseen issues.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this position. I urge you to uphold the Electoral College system, and invest in efforts to refine its implementation.

People are either walking to their destinations or riding their bicycles. Also the less you use your car, means less air pollution everywhere so the Earth is more healthier.

Limiting car usage could also help people's physical and mental health. Walking could lower your stress levels and let you think about the nature that you see instead of thinking about what your mad at. I know this from experience because I get stressed very easilyand walking anywhere helps me calm down. Another thing about limiting car usage is that the car wreck percentage would be lower than it is right now. There would also be less deaths in the world if they limited the usage of cars.

Did you know that there are aproximently 118 miles of bicycle paths only in Bogota? Well there is and according to Mockus, the city's major, ""It's the most of any Latin American city."" Also you could use the bicycle paths as walking paths for exercise or just to walk anywhere. People would be in more shape if they limited cars.

920,1,"Dear State Senator, In this essay I will be explaining why the Electoral College shouldn't be kept,and why we should do a popular vote instead to determine the president of the United States.

In my opinion we should do a popular vote because we U.S. citizens know what we want. The Electoral College may know what they want for themselves as a unit but honestly I think that the United States should stick to a popular vote. In an article I read called ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it states that state legislatures can technically be picking electors that will always defy the will of the people. I notice this to be very unfair because if electors are always going to defy what we say and want why should we vote. Isn't one of America's 1 catch phrases "" "" well in this case it seems to be "" "". In this article it also states that in many cases "" "" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please! So if the electors can choose for whomever they please why can't we. I also think that the Electoral College is unfair because of the winnertakeall system. Candidates don't have to spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. While they go to the states that they know they have a absolute chance of winning in and take those winning votes. So in this case I have to agree with Bob Dole: Abolish the Electoral College!

I also think its wrong that voters can't always control who their voting for because we all the freedom to our own opinions and in the process of the Electoral Collage they are basically just throwing all opinions in the trash. They obviously don't care and I see this as completely irrational and unfair. I know that may use the electoral Collage as a way to keep everyone calm but I think if they were to let the people vote they wouldn't have to be worried about us not being calm because that's us getting what we want and therefore why are we going to complain. I also consider the Electoral Collage electors high class. So in this case they are going to want to vote for the benefit of them, I think this is unfair to the lowerincome families because if the electors choose a president that is going to want to take all the benefits away from lowerincome families how are they going to live?

1148,0,"A life without cars sure sounds like a great idea for saving up less pollution and have less traffic jams, right? Well, that's a true fact, facing the reality that over the past few years we've had times and times again where we've polluted our own air over the repetitive over use of cars, specially because nowadays there's way more cars being sold from car dealerships like Ford, Mercedes, chevrolet, and etc. On the contrary, there's now been a few areas and cities in a few countries where there's been a shortage of using cars or none used at all. A life without cars can indeed help out so much more in many various occasions and issues like pollution, smog, and traffic.

Carfree cities are the best ways to improve in somewhat of a way for easier transportation and reduced air pollution. For example, as said from source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, on the first paragraph, ""VAUBAN, GermanyResidents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up on cars."" explains how this residence from the few in Germany have made it possible to be carfree. To add more, the author, Rosenthal, from this passage also explains that Vauban contains 5,500 residents making it the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life, in lines 47, paragraph 6. The main idea of this is that it's best to keeps cities, or even better whole countries carfree or low ratings of cars being used to help stop such as pollution and traffic jams.

Just like Vauban, Germany is carfree some other countries do their best as well to keep their cities and border safe from the damages and difficulties cars cause. As an example of this, source 2, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, explains in paragraph 10, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" As this clearly states, Paris has as well moved towards a much closer carfree city itself. Reason for this partial driving ban is because of smog caused by the pollution of cars, this explained on paragraph 17 on source 2 as the author, Duffer, says, ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" In comparison, soruce 3, ""CarFree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, explains how Bogota, Colombia in has a carfree day for devoiding traffic jams. As a few perks that were gained from this carfree day, in paragraph 28, said are: ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.",0,"a life without car sure sound like a great idea for save up less pollution and have less traffic jam right well that be a true fact face the reality that over the past few year we have have time and time again where we have pollute our own air over the repetitive over use of car specially because nowadays there be way more car be sell from car dealership like Ford Mercedes chevrolet and etc on the contrary there be now be a few area and city in a few country where there be be a shortage of use car or none use at all a life without car can indeed help out so much more in many various occasion and issue like pollution smog and traffic

1643,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:

Car usage has become an integral part of suburban life in many societies. However, there is a growing trend to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the overall quality of life. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage, as demonstrated in various examples from around the world. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can achieve a multitude of benefits, including reduced emissions, increased accessibility, and improved physical and mental well-being.

Body:

Paragraph 1:

Limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. For instance, in Vauban, Germany, an experimental car-free community, 70% of families do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold a car to move there. As a result, Vauban's residents experience reduced carbon emissions, with cars being responsible for only 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This example highlights the potential impact of limiting car usage on reducing environmental harm.

Paragraph 2:

Beyond environmental advantages, limiting car usage can improve accessibility to services and amenities. Smart planning, which focuses on compact communities with accessible public transportation, makes daily tasks more convenient. Instead of relying on cars, stores are located within walking distance on main streets, reducing the need for long-distance travel. This approach has been adopted in many places, including suburbs in the United States. By making suburbs more compact and accessible, the dependency on cars decreases, improving the overall quality of life for residents.

Paragraph 3:

Additionally, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on physical and mental well-being. Car-free communities, such as Vauban, create environments conducive to walking, cycling, and other physical activities. These means of transportation not only contribute to a healthier lifestyle but also reduce air pollution and noise pollution. Studies have shown that increased physical activity and reduced exposure to pollutants have significant health benefits, resulting in lower rates of obesity, respiratory diseases, and stress-related disorders.

Paragraph 4:

The success of limiting car usage is not limited to specific regions. Examples from around the world demonstrate the potential for positive change. For instance, a car-free day was implemented in Bogota, Colombia, to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event introduced millions of Colombians to alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and taking public buses. The overwhelming participation in the event highlights the willingness of people to embrace change and prioritize sustainability.

Conclusion:

Limiting car usage brings numerous advantages to individuals, communities, and the environment. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve accessibility, and enhance physical and mental well-being. The examples mentioned in this essay demonstrate the success and potential of limiting car usage, urging societies to reconsider their dependence on cars and embrace a more sustainable and healthier lifestyle.

940,0,"Living in a world covered in dark,suffocating smog is not the first thing that comes to mind when we imagine an ideal environment. The smog that hangs over our head at this very moment is an example of what humanity has contributed to this worlds health,disease. If we call this our home then we should find a suitable solution to provide a more stable condition of the Earth's wellbeing. Limiting car use is a universal solution in which countries across the globe are taking part of. It has been shown on numerous occasions that limiting car usage, or even going to the extreme of banning them, has created a stress free atmosphere, a healthier world, and has lead to economic growth.

The ""smart planning"" trend that has grown in popularity in the United States and Europe is a stepping stone to how we plan to stop the exaggerated use of cars. In Vauban, Germany with their 5,500 residents have made the ultimate sacrifice and have completly given up cars, besides the 40,000 parking spot you wish to obtain along with your house. A residence has remarked on how she was ""...happier this way than when she had a car,""that when she had a car she was ""always tense,"" not the exact response most people believe, yet eliminating that rushed environment has increased the supporters of anticars. businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza from Bogota, Columbia which has implemented an effective program that has banned the use of cars on certain days looks at this event as a ""good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" and as it has shown he seems to be right on that.

12% of the atmospher over Europe is made of of greenhouse gases while in a America, where car use is more frequent, in certain congested spots could be as high as 51%. Cars make an incredible barrier as to what we can achieve in environment conservation. On a Monday in Paris the city of lights the use of cars was banned by the government for the fog was at to of a horrendous state they needed to ""clear the air of a global city."" Even though on average the plague that is infesting the atmospher is approximately 147 micrograms of particulate matterPM per square meter, while in Brussels it is 114PM and in London 79.7, if this is what it is on average imagine how much worse it must've been to banish the use of cars to clear the air. Even though it seems to be quite a scarafice, as we see in Paris 4,000 people were fined for driving on that Monday and 27 of them had their cars impounded purely based on their reaction, we see a trend of the decresing intrest of buying and using cars anyway and after a point in time we see a posotive result in the long run. As Drexel University sociology professor puts it ""...we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift,"" as in relation to America one of the leaders in car production and passion. Preventing the use of cars will substantially help the environment, just that one day of a driving ban on Paris was able to let the smog clear up enought to allow driving the next day, I guess you can see those lights a little brighter now.

The fact it promotes healthy living and an increase in businesses in suburbs making tsuburbs more in touch with consumers needs as seen in Botoga where ""parks and sports centers have bloomed,"" and ,""new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up,"" it has morphed stressed societies into happier ones, and the potential to make for a better world is something undenyably needed in society today, a change to help us all.",0,"live in a world cover in dark suffocate smog be not the first thing that come to mind when we imagine an ideal environment the smog that hang over our head at this very moment be an example of what humanity have contribute to this world health disease if we call this our home then we should find a suitable solution to provide a more stable condition of the Earth 's wellbeing limit car use be a universal solution in which country across the globe be take part of it have be show on numerous occasion that limit car usage or even go to the extreme of ban they have create a stress free atmosphere a healthy world and have lead to economic growth

1606,0,"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage for a Smarter Future

Introduction:
The issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, specifically from vehicles, has become a pressing concern for both developed and developing nations. As a result, initiatives such as car-free neighborhoods, driving bans, and car-free days have been introduced to limit car usage. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on evidence from multiple sources, highlighting the benefits to the environment, public health, and quality of life.

Body Paragraphs:
1. Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions: 
Car emissions account for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, a leading cause of climate change. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's New York Times article, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change.

2. Improved air quality and public health:
Driving bans, such as the one implemented in Paris due to smog, not only help combat pollution but also improve air quality. In Robert Duffer's article from the Chicago Tribune, congestion in Paris decreased by 60 percent after a five-day driving ban, bringing the city's air pollution levels down. This improvement in air quality leads to a decrease in respiratory problems and other health issues caused by pollution, benefiting the overall well-being of citizens.

3. Enhanced accessibility and livability:
Smart planning, as highlighted in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, seeks to separate suburban life from excessive car usage. Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, serves as an example of how limiting car usage can lead to a more accessible and livable neighborhood. With stores located within walking distance and public transportation easily accessible, residents can lead more sustainable lives without the need for personal vehicles. This concept is being adopted worldwide, creating compact and accessible suburbs that prioritize public transportation over cars.

4. Economical and efficient transportation:
By limiting car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, communities can reduce the burden on infrastructure. Instead of investing in extensive road networks and parking spaces, resources can be diverted to improve public transportation systems. Car-free communities can also promote efficient car-sharing programs, reducing the need for individuals to own cars and saving them money on maintenance and other associated costs.

5. Changing cultural norms:
As mentioned in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This shift in behavior not only contributes to reduced emissions but also indicates a cultural change in our perception of personal vehicles. Younger generations are less concerned about car ownership and prioritize alternative transportation options. This change in attitude presents an opportunity to reshape our cities and prioritize sustainable modes of transportation.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and far-reaching, benefiting the environment, public health, and the livability of communities. By adopting smart planning principles and encouraging alternative modes of transport, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance accessibility, and promote sustainable transportation practices. Implementing these changes now can help secure a smarter and more sustainable future for all.",1,"title advantage of limit car usage for a Smarter Future

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the creation of more sustainable communities. The German suburb of Vauban is a prime example of how life can go on without cars. Streets in Vauban are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. This design encourages residents to use public transportation or walk and cycle instead. In fact, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. This shift towards car-free living reduces traffic congestion, noise pollution, and the need for large parking spaces. It also promotes a stronger sense of community and encourages people to interact with each other.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of public health. The article highlights how passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease these emissions and improve air quality. In Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat intense smog levels, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. By reducing air pollution, we can reduce the prevalence of respiratory problems and improve the overall well-being of citizens. Additionally, promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking and cycling can help individuals lead more active lifestyles, reducing the risk of obesity and related health issues.

Limiting car usage also plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming. The decrease in driving observed in the United States suggests a cultural shift away from car dependence, with people opting for alternative transportation options. This shift could have far-reaching implications for carbon emissions and the environment. If the trend continues, it will have a positive impact on reducing emissions and combating climate change. Moreover, limiting car usage can prompt car manufacturers to adapt their business models to cater to changing consumer demands. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies, focusing on a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It creates more sustainable communities, improves public health, and helps mitigate climate change. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the success of car-free initiatives in reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, and fostering a sense of community. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and reducing our reliance on cars, we can work towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

1287,0,"The limiting on car usage would be a huge positive on the world and the people. As everyone knows, cars now adays are the key to ""Making it around the world"". They say cars make your life easier and its good for the economy. Some of those facts are true but at the same time not exactly.

Automobiles are the ""linchpin of suburbs"". People can not live without their cars and need them for where ever they need to go work,the park,the store. Sooner or later in the future humans might not live at all with the usage of cars. In the article In German Suburbs,Life Goes On Without Cars, it says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"". All these fums and such are being spread in the air. And in Paris, pollution was a big effect on the people. Filing the air with smokes and harmful gases that affect a persons health. Do you want to go outside and have a hard time breathing? Nope i didnt think so. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after intensifying smog. Diesel fuel was the cause of that only because France favors diesel over gasoline. This decrease in cars will be better for implications for carbon emissions and the environment.

When you buy a car, you need space for it to stay in. A space can cost up to 40,000 max. That is alot of money you could save for other appliances and daily life products. Also with a car you may get fines for speeding or anything in that state. In the article Paris bans driving due to smog Robert Duffer said motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. The less cars the better! why go through all that trouble. As well as less cars means no highway usage meaning more construction for buildings and stores. And think about it! More stores you can shop at and save more money to shop at those stores because you arent buying gas everywhere you go and paying for car insurance.

Cars are beneficial for alot of things. But for the people and our future,it would be best to cut out cars and make our lives healthier and better. It will become a huge positive on the world.",0,"the limiting on car usage would be a huge positive on the world and the people as everyone know car now aday be the key to make it around the world they say car make your life easy and its good for the economy some of those fact be true but at the same time not exactly

1141,1,"The electoral college was a great attempt to give a reliable system of selecting the president, but it just does not work the way our founding fathers wanted it to. Many people throughout the country have brought this up as a major issue because they also agree. The other option that people would prefer to have would be selecting the president by the popular vote, which is the smarter path. This method is more democratic, it has a smaller chance of producing unreliable results, and it encourages voters to still vote in states where there is already a predominant political party.

The electoral college is not democratic. The method of selecting people for it is generally controlled by each candidate's political party, and their responsibilities vary based on the party's wants. The people who select the candidates for the electoral college are not part of the popular population they are part of a political party. Next, when people go to vote for the president, they are not voting for the president, but actually voting for a slate of electors that in their turn vote for the president. And to take this to the next step, as shown in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""Most states have a winnertakesall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" If voters vote for the candidate that ends up losing, poof, all their votes are given to the other team. To atleast make this a little more fair, instead of voting for the president, voters should cast votes for the electoral college members that are choosing their president. That way, you can at least do research on the people whom you are really voting for and make the best decision possible.

The popular vote is the most reliable way to get results from the people. It is the most raw, unbreakable way of selecting the highest political figure of the country. On the other hand, the electoral college's slight stretches have the possibility of unreliable results. In ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"", it becomes known that ""...thanks to the quirks of the electoral college Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". It is still argued that the electoral members chosen are extremely trustworthy :""each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed"" from ""In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". However, even in the continuation of the fragment above, even Richard A. Posner ,the author, admits ""however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national vote."" The electoral college members are trusted to vote for whom they were voted for, but their job is to be a highly knowledgeable political expert and if they see the other president as a better choice, then it can become very unfair.

The electoral college discourages people to vote in countries where there is already a dominating party. For example, California is mostly a democratic country that usually casts a highly populated vote for the democratic party's electoral candidates. So why should republicans consider voting in this area? The government has always tried to push out that ""every vote counts"", but is this really the case? Another good point of this is explained by Bradford Plumer again in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" : ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races of 'swing' states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina..."" Swing states, as the're called, are the places where presidential candidates always hang around. They barely bother with the other states because they know they have already got or lost the vote in them...

Some laws were brilliantly passed, but had to eventually be deconstructed due to present implications. The electoral college is not democratic, doesn't produce reliale results, and discourages voters. It is time that we abolish this college just at we overturned the eighteenth amendment before.",0,"the electoral college be a great attempt to give a reliable system of select the president but it just do not work the way our found father want it to many people throughout the country have bring this up as a major issue because they also agree the other option that people would prefer to have would be select the president by the popular vote which be the smart path this method be more democratic it have a small chance of produce unreliable result and it encourage voter to still vote in state where there be already a predominant political party

1115,0,"Zroom! Cars have been developing for hundreds of years all over the world. They have become very dangerous to the environment and there are many advantages to limiting the use of them.

There is only so much space on earth and lot of it is taken up by parking. No matter where you go there will always be parking spots on the fertile ground that we need to preserve. Garages, street parking, and driveways not only house vehicles but they also take up valuable space! By limiting the use of cars we can cut back on the land wasted to house them.

Another important advantage to limiting car use is that it will save you money! Everyday we hear about a new car that just came on the market but the price only keeps on increasing. No one wants a cheap car that they are embaresseed to be seen in and many pay vigorously for new upgrades. The biggest expense is gas, which you will have to pay for almost everyday as the price keeps rising.

Finally, car usage is extremely bad for the environment. Paris is in days of nearrecord pollution and its become so bad that they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Every time you start your car smog comes out of your exhaust polluting the air. After awhile it falls back to the ground and sticks so when it rains the roads become very slick which is a major hazard.

In conclusion, we should all limit the use of cars. Although its ok to use them in moderation they are still space consuming, expensive, and bad for the environment.",0,"Zroom car have be develop for hundred of year all over the world they have become very dangerous to the environment and there be many advantage to limit the use of they

655,1,"Dear our state Senator, I am writing to you for not only myself but for the citizens of our state. I do not agree with The Electoral College and I think that our way of voting for president should be based off of popular vote. I know our state and our country has been using electoral college as our way of voting for a very long time throughout our nations history. But Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. and i'll tell you whats wrong with the electoral college.

As you may know we do not directly vote for our president. we vote for our electors who will hopefully vote for the president we want. when the time comes for voting the state legislature are technically responsible for picking our electors. We the people are not always in control of who they vote for and the electors could always defy our will. We do not always control who they vote for. So is it really fair if we vote for an elector who doesnt even support us and our say in who we want to lead our country?

Another reason why i do not agree with the electoral college is for the smaller states. they do not have as much of a say in who runs our country like we do. luckily we are one of the biggest states along with california. but in smaller states they almost have no say at all. they dont even see campaigns because no one running for office pays attention to the smaller states. For instance, The campaign in 2000 seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all.

One of the biggest faults in the electoral college even though it is very unlikely but not impossible is a tie. As you already know if there was a tie the election would be thrown to the house of representatives,where state delegations vote on the president. because each state casts only one vote, the houses selections would hardly even show the will of the people. the people would barely have any say whatsoever. does that seem fair to you?

Those are the reasons why i and many other citizens do not agree with the electoral college. its unfair to us , the people, and smaller states. America is known for being the country of freedom and choice, but if we the people barely have say in who runs our country, are we really eligible to be called that? thats why i think we should use popular vote as our way of electing our president.",0,"dear our state Senator I be write to you for not only myself but for the citizen of our state I do not agree with the Electoral College and I think that our way of voting for president should be base off of popular vote I know our state and our country have be use electoral college as our way of vote for a very long time throughout our nation history but Electoral college be unfair outdated and irrational and I 'll tell you what s wrong with the electoral college

251,0,"Are cars beginning to go out of fashion? Over the last few years, fewer and fewer people are getting their driver's license, and less people are buying cars. That's because walking or taking public transportation where you need to go can be more beneficial than driving. Using alternative transportation decreases stress, lowers air pollution, and eliminates the cost of owning a car. These reasons are causing people to eliminate personal vehicles out of their lives.

To begin, using alternative transportation can lower stress. Millions of people around the world face the same problem every morning and afternoon: traffic. Traffic jams cause people to be late for work, causing their stress levels to go up. Stress can lead people into depression or become tense. Eliminating a car from someone's life can allow them to be happy. Instead of driving, many people are starting to walk to work, or take a public bus to where they need to go. If more people begin to stop driving, the roads will be less jammed, which will lower road congestion, leading to less stress. Getting rid of your car can be a key element to eliminating stress.

Second, walking or taking a bus lowers air pollution. In France, air pollution was so bad, the government set a oneday ban on driving motorvehicles. Instead, residents could take public busses free of charge, or walk. Anyone who decided to drive their vehicle on the day they were banned, faced a 31 fine. Another city in Colombia also started a similar campaign. Government officials in Bogota, Colombia set a one day ban in the city called ""the Day Without Cars"". The turnout was large, people rode busses, rode bikes, or walked to wherever they needed to go. This eliminated traffic james, and lowered air pollution. Violaters of the ban had to pay a 25 fine. Other countries surely will soon do the same thing.

Lastly, the cost to own a car is far too expensive. Buying a car leads to many problems. the cost of paying off your car after you buy it can overwhelm many people. Having to pay hundreds of dollars every month to repair your car or pay for gas can lead you into debt. Many individuals have become homeless because they can't afford to pay for the things they need, such as a car. Without a car, you save thousands of dollars you can use to pay off other things you might owe.

To conclude, using alternative transportation instead of a car can be very beneficial. It lowers stress, eliminates air pollution, and eliminates the expenses of a car. More and more people are beginning to outlaw cars from their lives, and it is helping the world as well as themselves.",0,"be car begin to go out of fashion over the last few year few and few people be get their driver 's license and less people be buy car that be because walk or take public transportation where you need to go can be more beneficial than drive use alternative transportation decrease stress lower air pollution and eliminate the cost of own a car these reason be cause people to eliminate personal vehicle out of their life

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to you today as a concerned citizen to advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. Despite a considerable dissenting opinion, I believe the Electoral College plays an indispensable role in safeguarding our nation’s democratic principles and ensuring a fair representation of all states in the electoral process.

The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College with the intention to balance the power of the majority with the rights of individual states. As noted by Judge Richard A. Posner, in his article 'In Defense of the Electoral College', the Electoral College encourages a trans-regional appeal rather than a concentration of power in highly populated areas. This system ensures that candidates will not focus solely on populous regions but also address the needs of rural or less-populated areas, thereby fostering a broad-based policy platform that accounts for all citizens' interests.

The Electoral College also safeguards against the possibility of an unresolved election outcome. As explained in the Federal Register document, the Electoral College’s majority-vote requirement makes a decisive outcome more likely, reducing the chance of election disputes. Moreover, it overcomes the problem of an election where no candidate receives a majority of popular votes and eliminates the need for costly and contentious run-off elections.

However, I do empathize with the concerns raised about the Electoral College, especially about its alleged unfairness, as argued by Bradford Plumer. But as Posner points out, these claims fail to consider that the Electoral College strikes a necessary compromise, keeping our vastly diverse country united under a common federal structure.

In conclusion, despite its complexity and potential for occasional anomalies, the Electoral College represents each American's voice and worth. Therefore, I urge you to voice our state's support for retaining this system in Congress.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this vital issue.

1384,0,"In our rapidly evolving society, the need for sustainable practices has become increasingly evident, and one area where individual actions can make a substantial impact is in limiting car usage. The advantages of such a shift extend beyond personal convenience to encompass critical aspects of our environment, public health, and community well-being. Drawing from various sources, including reports from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the World Economic Forum, and the World Health Organization (WHO), it is clear that reducing reliance on automobiles is a multifaceted solution with far-reaching benefits.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage lies in the positive impact on the environment. The EPA's research underscores the significant role transportation plays in greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. By curbing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease air pollution and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. This aligns with the global call for sustainable practices to preserve our planet for future generations.

Beyond environmental concerns, limiting car usage addresses the pervasive issue of traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas. The World Economic Forum emphasizes the economic advantages associated with reduced traffic congestion, such as lower fuel consumption and improved productivity due to decreased travel time. This not only makes urban centers more efficient but also enhances the overall quality of life for citizens, making it a compelling reason to reconsider our reliance on personal vehicles.

Public health emerges as another crucial consideration in the case for limiting car usage. The WHO has established a direct link between air pollution from vehicular emissions and various health issues, including respiratory diseases and cardiovascular problems. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can reduce the pollutants that pose serious threats to public health, thereby creating a healthier and more resilient society.

Furthermore, the shift from car-centric to community-centric transportation fosters a sense of togetherness. Studies have consistently shown that communities designed for pedestrian-friendly activities result in residents who are more physically active and socially connected. Encouraging walking, cycling, and the use of public transit not only reduces individual carbon footprints but also contributes to the creation of vibrant, socially engaged neighborhoods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not merely a personal choice but a collective responsibility with wide-ranging benefits. Drawing on evidence from diverse sources, it is evident that such a shift can positively impact the environment, alleviate traffic congestion, enhance public health, and foster stronger communities. As we navigate the challenges of the 21st century, reevaluating our reliance on cars becomes a pivotal step towards creating a sustainable and harmonious future.",1,"in our rapidly evolve society the need for sustainable practice have become increasingly evident and one area where individual action can make a substantial impact be in limit car usage the advantage of such a shift extend beyond personal convenience to encompass critical aspect of our environment public health and community well being draw from various source include report from the Environmental Protection Agency EPA the World Economic Forum and the World Health Organization who it be clear that reduce reliance on automobile be a multifaceted solution with far reach benefit

 in conclusion limit car usage be not merely a personal choice but a collective responsibility with wide range benefit draw on evidence from diverse source it be evident that such a shift can positively impact the environment alleviate traffic congestion enhance public health and foster strong community as we navigate the challenge of the 21st century reevaluate our reliance on car become a pivotal step towards create a sustainable and harmonious future"
1260,0,"The cities of Vauban, Germany Paris, France and Bogota, Colombia all have something in common. They have all taken measures to use cars minimally for at least a small period of time. The results of car use are pollution and accidents among other large scale issues. The cities previously mentioned, however, have taken active roles in preventing these issues. It is no guess as to why the pollution is created ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" states Elisabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times. A seemingly simple, but effective, idea could prevent the pollution caused by cars limiting car usage. Cars have been a major cause of stress with people who always rush to arrive at their destinations, and social interaction in person has significantly shot onto the negative end of the spectrum because of the invention of cars. By limiting car usage, the overly tense and smogged communities alike would benefit.

A frustrated, tense driver is not an uncommon occurrence. The term ""road rage"" was not spontaneously thought of. The purpose of cars is to transport someone or something from destination ""A"" to destination ""B"" in a short amount of time. This makes the very nature of cars one of urgency and with urgency comes stress. Stressed drivers have been the cause of many a car accident. All it takes is someone who is almost late for a meeting to speed too quickly for an accident to occur. Cutting down on car usage would exponentially decrease the number of car accidents, and it is likely to increase the overall happiness of a community that harbors less cars on their streets. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" states Heidrun Walter of Vauban, Germany. The community of Vauban has given up their cars. In fact, there are only two places to park there the parking garage requires a 40,000 fee to reserve a space, and it is rare to find a private garage for a home. Vauban is an example of what is likely the beginning of more communities based on minimal car use. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" states David Goldberg, official of Transportation of America. ""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting 'car reduced' communities..."" Elisabeth Rosenthal Communities are realizing the benefits of reduced usage.

An astounding statistic: ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Elisabeth Rosenthal Pollution is the main concern for the generation of fossil fuel consumers. It is not unknown that cars cause pollution because of the diesel and gasoline that fuels the car. The pollution cars bring will not cease to multiply until cars are used less, and hybrid cars are not necessarily the answer because there has always been controversy on whether people will actually buy them with time. Cities who ban car usage see significant changes in the quality of their atmosphere and an example of this is Paris. Paris, the travel destination of both adventurers and lovers, experiences some of the worst pollution even when compared to Beijing, China. ""Congestion car traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" stated Robert Duffer of the Chicago Tribune. Paris benefited from the bans and reduced the amount of smog in the city. Paris took action on their car usage issue and it would be beneficial for other places to follow suit as pollution is an increasinly major environmental issue and health hazard.

Not only would pollution be shifting downward, but city projects would improve with the limited use of automobiles. Cars promote the improvement of highways and roads. This creates a situation in which the city funds the roads, but fails to focus on other important city structures such as sidewalks and local stores. Roads are constantly run down and massive amounts of tax money go into repairing them, but limiting car usage would prevent road damage and change the city's view on other structures. Bogota, Columbia has a ""Day without Cars"" to ""...promote alternative transportation and reduce smog,"" states Andrew Selsky of Seattle Times. With just one day reserved for not using cars, ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Andrew Selsky Reducing car use enhances the experience of those who normally don't use cars because of improved bike paths, sidewalks, and is the foundation for a more lively city community.

Luckily, the United States seems to already be on the path to lowering numbers of cars used. ""...Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by,"" states Elisabeth Rosenthal from "" "" . America is one of the biggest mascots of the car industry they have always been on top of advertisement and 'showing off cars' with companies such as Ford and Mercedes. The decline of car usage is beneficial in America for the environment as emissions will be lowered, but the car companies would need to find a different tactic to generate or maintain money flow. The resulting effect is that not only would limiting car usage aid the environment, decrease stress levels, and promote structural integrity of a city, but it would be the dawn of a new cultural age based on a community that has a better transportation system to ""...conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety,"" as proposed by Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company.

540,0,"Mustangs, Mercedes, Hummers , and the ""Punch buggy "" are just a few brands of vehicles well known in America. vehicles today are big factor in life for the reason that cars are used every single day all around the world as transportation and although we have the bus or other ways to get to places , driving is the most selected choice to get to a location. With that being said , vehicles being used everyday has it positives and negatives. Positives could be how it takes you to a location quicker than riding a bike or taking a walk , but have you ever thought all the negatives there is when a car being used has ?Could you only imagine a world without car? It may seem like a crazy idea to think a world without cars but a life without cars could be a well functional world for the reason that cars could have contribution to pollution in our air or could make the world a so called different place.

In Addition, driving could have a contribution to pollution. Many may not think about it but cars emissions pollute the air we breath. In a article called ""Paris bans driving due to smogs"" it states how "" after days of near record pollution in the air ,Paris enforced partial driving to clear their pollution. Also how cold nights and warm days caused a warmer layer of air that trapped cars emission when used in Paris."" Pollution in our air may seem a bit scary but the movement of less driving has already began without us noticing.In another article named "" The End of Car Culture"" it speaks on the subject "" there has been a decrease in America in buying cars and driving."" Which is a great start to a better future in our world.

Furthermore , We can make the world a so called different place for the better. In a article called ""In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars"" it states how ""their world with any cars has been successful by making where they live more compact and accessible to public transportation. This new approach now stores can be placed a walkway from main street than malls along a distant hallways."" Many places around the world have made a step to a better world for example in a article named "" Carfree day is spinning into big hit in Bogota"" it states "" they had a day free of cars aka driving free to reduced thier pollution and have a more clean better world. Results from this event turned out successful , for that other countries have joined this event."" In Conclusion , A world without cars may seem crazy however just think of all the damages it does to the world than the positives because pollution is not something easy to get rid of and by stepping up to make change as it already began will help us live in a better clean world.",0,"mustang Mercedes Hummers and the Punch buggy be just a few brand of vehicle well know in America vehicle today be big factor in life for the reason that car be use every single day all around the world as transportation and although we have the bus or other way to get to place drive be the most select choice to get to a location with that be say vehicle be use everyday have it positive and negative positive could be how it take you to a location quick than ride a bike or take a walk but have you ever think all the negative there be when a car be use have could you only imagine a world without car it may seem like a crazy idea to think a world without car but a life without car could be a well functional world for the reason that car could have contribution to pollution in our air or could make the world a so call different place

779,0,"Cars have always been used to get from point A to point B. That is how the people in society know what cars are for. However, there are other alternatives when is comes to going form one destination to another. Citizens should limit their car usage. It helps with the terrible traffic on the street. Also, there will be no more pollution in the air. In addition, citizens can be able to enjoy the world.

Everyone has been caught in traffic, whether it is going to work or school or meeting up with someone. Everyone has been in traffic before. People can prevent traffic form happening. There is carpooling, it can help limit traffic on the streets. Just like it states in source three, ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" There are other ways to avoid and stop traffic. Not everyone needs to take their own personal car to work. They can either car pool or take public transportation to save money because gas isn't cheap these days. In addition, traffic sometimes end up leading to accidents. There are several people who died in a car accident due to someone speeding because he or she doesn't want to wait in the traffic. However, if everyone just finds another alternative way to get to his or her destination, then no one has to die. Just like it explains in proclaims in source four, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" This qoute listed some alternatives way to get somewhere. By doing these things it will not only limit the traffic but the resources and the safety of other people. Traffic isn't a fun place to be in, so find another way to get to his or her destination can prevent traffic.

Air pollution is everywhere we go. Whether someone travels to Japan, India, or South America. There willbe air pollution there. It might not have same amount of air pollution as other countries but there is still pollution. Why? Because there are people who uses his or her personal car not thinking about what happens to the air that they breathe. However, there is a solution to limit the pollution in the air. Limiting car usage or find another way to get to the certain destination. Mr. siva even claims that ""A car is just a means of getting from A to B..."" Cars is just a means of transportation. So are bicycles, trucks, buses, traind. However, all these have one thing in common, they are all going form destination A to destination B. Biking, walking, skating are some way to stop the gas from the vehicles from polluting the air. Actually, by using these methods pollution can be reduced. For example source three states, ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have bee replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic..."" When people don't use his or her car and decides to find another way to get to their destination it helps reduce the traffic.

There are several people who say that they know what the real world is since he or she travels all the time in their car. However, do people really know the sounds of kids laughter when walking down the side walk or a bicycle bell violently ringing at someone to get out of their way? Not a lot of people know this because they are usually used to their vehicles getting them places. People will argue that they have heard all of those before and that they were happier. But Ms. Walter thinkgs other wise, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Ms. Walter has been walking on the streets and she hears the swish of bicycles and the talkative children and occastional a distant motor. These help people better appreciate the world that they live in because not everything will last forever. In addition to this, less cars means more people walking which means that several people will end up walking pass a shop and look what is inside. For instance in source three is explains, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed through the city uneven...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" It helps by walking to find new stores or restaurants people never heard of.

Several people believe that the only way to get somewhere is by car. That isn't necessarily true. Skating, walking, biking, car pooling or public transportation can help get anyone from point A to B. Yes, it will take longer on foot than by car but it helps the environment, it stops from the air getting all the gasoline form the cars. It is faster than being stuck in traffic. Someone who is biking to school can be five minutes late while soneone who is took their car and got stuck in traffic can be an hour late. Limiting car usage is a way that everyone can explore the world than being stuck in that four or tw door car. Limiting car usage has its downs but it also have its perks.",0,"car have always be use to get from point a to point B. that be how the people in society know what car be for however there be other alternative when be come to go form one destination to another citizen should limit their car usage it help with the terrible traffic on the street also there will be no more pollution in the air in addition citizen can be able to enjoy the world

1213,1,"The Electoral College is a process put in place by the founding fathers as a compromise for the election of the President. It is a combination gote of the Congress and of the citizens of the United States. The Electoral College is on of the most disputed political topics right now. The electoral college is a proper method for electing presidents because it forces presidential candidates to have transregional appeal and it rules out the possibility of an election where neither candidate recieves the majority of the gotes.

The Electoral College doesn't allow a candidate to win by gaining their electoral gotes from one region. As stated in source 3, ""no region has enough electoral gotes to elect a president"" meaning that if a candidate were to only campaign in a region that they knew would got for them, then there is no possible way they would win. For example, in 2012 Mitt rodney was a favorite in the south so he had no incentive on campaigning heavily in other states because that he had won the south over completely. Not only did he not win a major electoral state, Florida, but he also didn't campaign in ohter states for which he gained no electoral gotes. Even by some chance that they win, there is a very small chance of them being reelected because the regions that they didn't campaign in will feel disenfranchised and that will cause them not to gote for the president again. So if a candidate doesn't campaign in all regions that doesn't mean he won't win the election the first time, but he is likely to lose the reelection.

With the Electoral College process in place, it rules out the possibility of an candidate not winning the majority of the gotes. For example, their have been two elections where a president only had 43 percent of the popular gotes, which some people would think that would be enough, but the those presidents had the majority of the electoral gotes which is what caused them to win. Even though there is a slight possibility of this happening, there are always those couple of states that are last minute decisions and are called ""tossup states"" because nobody ever knows who will win that state over and it might be a state like Louisiana, who only has 8 electoral gotes but 8 gotes is enough to break a tie and even win the election for someone.

On the other hand, some people might argue that the Electoral College method might turn off potential goters due to a candidate showing that they have no interest in carrying that state due to what party that state carries, but no one goter can decide an election, and that is because the goter doesn't gote for what president they want, but for what electors they want who in part will gote for the candidate. Though they have a valid argument the Electoral College is still the right method for the job.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is the proper method because it forces presidents to campaign in multiple regions and it rules out the possibility of a tie in the election.

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as our method of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to direct election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College serves several important purposes and should be preserved.

First of all, it is crucial to understand the historical significance of the Electoral College. As the Office of the Federal Register explains, the founding fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between election by Congress and direct election by the people. This compromise was necessary to maintain a balance of power between states and ensure that regional interests were taken into account. Abolishing the Electoral College would neglect this important aspect and potentially lead to the disenfranchisement of smaller states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Judge Richard A. Posner argues that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely compared to a dispute over the popular vote. The winner-take-all system ensures that a candidate with even a slight plurality in a state secures all of that state's electoral votes. This leads to a decisive electoral-vote victory and reduces the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates must campaign across the country and consider the interests of different regions. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on heavily populated areas and disregarding the concerns of less populous regions. By maintaining the Electoral College, we ensure that all regions have a say in the election and that the president represents the whole nation.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. This was evident in the 2012 election, where candidates focused their efforts on states with toss-up electoral votes. Voters in swing states are more likely to be attentive and informed, as they know their votes hold significant weight in deciding the election. This results in more thoughtful voters playing a crucial role in the electoral process.

The Electoral College also balances the influence of large and small states. As Judge Posner points out, the Electoral College restores some weight to large states that lose representation due to Senate apportionment. This ensures that candidates pay attention to both big and small states during their campaigns, preventing a disproportionate focus on heavily populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In situations where no candidate wins a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections can complicate and prolong the electoral process. With the Electoral College, a clear winner emerges, even if the candidate only has a plurality of the popular vote. This streamlines the election process and ensures a decisive outcome.

I understand that some argue the Electoral College can discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning. However, the fact that half of the eligible American population continues to vote in presidential elections shows that voters express their political preferences irrespective of the impact on the national outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves important purposes in our democratic system and should be preserved. It provides a historical compromise, ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages attention to swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. I urge you to consider these points and vote in favor of keeping the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will take my views into account when making decisions pertaining to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving our great state and country.

Sincerely,

 another benefit of the Electoral College be that it encourage presidential candidate to have tran regional appeal with no region have enough electoral vote to elect a president candidate must campaign across the country and consider the interest of different region this prevent candidate from solely focus on heavily populated area and disregard the concern of less populous region by maintain the Electoral College we ensure that all region have a say in the election and that the president represent the whole nation 

 additionally the Electoral College encourage candidate to pay attention to swing state this be evident in the 2012 election where candidate focus their effort on state with toss up electoral vote voter in swing state be more likely to be attentive and inform as they know their vote hold significant weight in decide the election this result in more thoughtful voter play a crucial role in the electoral process 

 the Electoral College also balance the influence of large and small state as Judge Posner point out the Electoral College restore some weight to large state that lose representation due to Senate apportionment this ensure that candidate pay attention to both big and small state during their campaign prevent a disproportionate focus on heavily populated area 

 lastly the Electoral College eliminate the need for run off election in situation where no candidate win a majority of the popular vote run off election can complicate and prolong the electoral process with the Electoral College a clear winner emerge even if the candidate only have a plurality of the popular vote this streamline the election process and ensure a decisive outcome 

 I understand that some argue the Electoral College can discourage potential voter in state where their preferred candidate have little chance of win however the fact that half of the eligible american population continue to vote in presidential election show that voter express their political preference irrespective of the impact on the national outcome 

 in conclusion the Electoral College serve important purpose in our democratic system and should be preserve it provide a historical compromise ensure certainty of outcome promote trans regional appeal encourage attention to swing state balance the influence of large and small state and eliminate the need for run off election I urge you to consider these point and vote in favor of keep the Electoral College 

 thank you for your time and consideration I trust that you will take my view into account when make decision pertain to this matter I appreciate your dedication to serve our great state and country 

 sincerely

1601,0,"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly recognized around the world. One example of a community that has successfully implemented this concept is Vauban, Germany. In Vauban, cars are not allowed on the streets except for a few main thoroughfares and designated parking areas. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars and 57 percent sold their cars to move to this car-free community (Rosenthal, 2009). This experiment in low-car suburban life is part of a larger trend in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world to separate suburbs from excessive car usage (Rosenthal, 2009). 

The reduction of car usage in suburbs is crucial as it directly addresses the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with passenger cars accounting for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting car usage in suburbs, we can make a significant impact in reducing these emissions.

One of the key benefits of limiting car usage is the potential for more sustainable transportation options. In Vauban, for example, the community is designed in a way that promotes walking and biking. Stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than being located on distant highways (Rosenthal, 2009). This kind of smart planning not only reduces the need for cars, but also encourages healthier and more active lifestyles.

Limiting car usage also has positive impacts on congestion and air pollution. Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to combat smog caused by excessive car emissions. The ban led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion and significantly improved air quality in the city (Duffer, 2014). This demonstrates the immediate benefits that can be achieved by reducing car usage in densely populated areas.

Furthermore, car-free initiatives such as the annual car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, have been successful in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog (Selsky, 2002). These initiatives not only improve air quality, but also help to create a sense of community by encouraging people to engage in activities such as hiking, biking, and skating together.

The shift away from car culture is not limited to specific areas or communities. Studies in the United States have shown a decrease in the number of miles driven per person, suggesting that Americans are driving less and potentially reaching a point of peak driving (Rosenthal, 2013). This shift in behavior has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions from transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting sustainable transportation options, reducing congestion and air pollution, and fostering a sense of community. Initiatives such as car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days are just a few examples of how this concept is being implemented around the world. As we continue to make progress in limiting car usage, we move closer to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.",1,"the advantage of limit car usage be becoming increasingly recognize around the world one example of a community that have successfully implement this concept be Vauban Germany in Vauban car be not allow on the street except for a few main thoroughfare and designate parking area as a result 70 percent of family in Vauban do not own car and 57 percent sell their car to move to this car free community Rosenthal 2009 this experiment in low car suburban life be part of a large trend in Europe the United States and other part of the world to separate suburb from excessive car usage Rosenthal 2009

764,1,"Dear Senator PROPER_NAME, The purpose of this letter is to fight for the cause of removing the Electoral College and voting simply by popular vote. With evidence from ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" by Richard A. Ponser, I will elaborate on this subject. Now, since I am only fourteen, I do not claim to have all knowledge and be an expert on this method of voting, but it is not the way to choose our country's leader.

The Electoral College is a compromise between who the people of America chose and who Congress has chosen. This is an incorrect method of selecting the President. The Constitution states that we the people have the choice to select our government not Congress. Yes, the constitutions founding fathers also established the Electoral College, but it is a thing of the past. As Richard A. Ponser writes, an ""anchorism"" In Defense of the Electoral College, par. 1, if you will. Moreover, the Electoral College does not belong in this day and age it is something that is outdated and in need of replacement.

The Electoral College also does not allow citizens to exercise their right to vote for their President, since Congress also has their say in the matter. The voting process was created for the citizens not the people who are in the government. In fact, Bradford Plumer states that ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The Indefensible Electoral College, par. 1 This process of voting for President is undesired and despised my many people, by over half of the voters in America. The Office of the Federal Register writes that the Electoral College is ""a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens."" Why does Congress have any sort of influence or say in this matter? The people choose their government not the governemt itself!

Alright, the Electoral College is something that should not be used, by I can see the point of its purpose. The popular vote of the citizens can be infulenced by others, or advertisements and propoganda from political parties. Some voters are biased and overlook the negative things of the candidates because they do not wish to believe that this person does not support or believe everything they do. The Electoral College helps to balance that out. ""No region... has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" In Defense of the Electoral College, par. 5 Richard A. Ponser asserts this in his article, as well as the fact that no region or place has any reason to go about ""increasing his plurality"" par. 5 to make sure that a candidate will win. The Electoral College prevents this, resulting in a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and Congress.

To come to a conclusion, I have stated that the Electoral College is not a method that should be used to choose the President of the United States. It is outdated and does not allow citizens to choose the leader of their country. However, is balances out the popular vote and the Congress's vote.

575,0,"Automobiles are the key essential to people's everyday life. It allows them to get from point A to point B. But the outcome from the rise of these machines, are the amount of pollution they had cause. Limiting there usage seems the right action to do. Our specimen has been living for thousands of year without automobiles. What's the point of using them if their risking the life of our environment.

An advantage of limiting cars could be that it lowers the amount of air pollution, which causes global warming. From Beijing to France, being as the most polluted cities in the world. Imagine the amount of smog and intensity that the people have to face, having gasoline being spewed on you. On the contrary, the city of Vauban being built in 2006. It has been a prime example of a glorious city without the needs of automobiles. Kids to adults living an prosperic life, riding bicycles or just taking a stroll down the sidewalk. The store is only a few blocks away, basically all you need is a pair of legs. The whole fault in our system is due to our lack of judgement. Having our malls or stores being built nearly miles away from homes, on paved roadways or highways. Obviously an automobile is needed, but this will only cause the major destruction of our environment. Limited transportation is when we really can tell if were able to stop this rapid growth of pollution.

Our generation of kids and adults, thinks that a car is mandatory. But in reality, not every individual should own a car. From 2001 to 2009, the decrease of teens from the age sixteen to twenty one obtaining driver's license. Has dramatically declined, due to the realization of the amount of money they could save. From taking public transportation or carpooling with friends. It could help them save money, rather than spending money on gas. Which could range from 1.50 to 4.20, depending on the circumstances. These kids or adults could use that amount of money saved for future plans. Their are more pros than cons when limiting the usage of cars. The people of Bogota, Colombia celebrate a day without any vehicles. All you can see, is the broad smiles of the people's faces and utterly shocking the most, is that the streets are busy with people rather than automobiles. Imagine if were able to do such a thing, the amount of stress that would vanish. Dealing with traffic or pondering your mind to the amount of gas you need. It would simply just vanish in a blink of an eye.

If we were able to create vast systems of high tech highways to subways. Then we can manage to build programs or new forms of transportation. Without the hassle of using a vehicle, to spawning industrial factories where they are made from. An prime example is New York's recent bikesharing programs and its skyrocketing tunnel tolls. The main priority of this creation is to lower the usage of cars. Being one of the America's highly populated and dense cities. The scale or outcome of this program of limiting cars, could decide the factor if changes are possible. Then if so, then this new system can be an advantage or an example of what we can do to lower our usage of cars. That creates the majority of air pollution across the entire face of this planet.

In the end, the advantages of limiting cars or any form of transportation. Could lower the amount of air pollution, and the oncoming production of resources that affects our environment. But mainly create an atmosphere that will all humans alike to every single organism, to be able to live a prosperic life. Without the haze of dense smog, and stress of traffic jams.

1446,1,"I trust this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to share my perspective on a matter of great significance to our democratic processвЂ”the debate surrounding the Electoral College and the potential shift to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States.

As a concerned citizen, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is crucial for safeguarding the interests of all states, regardless of their size or population density. One of the key arguments in favor of the Electoral College, as elucidated by [Author], is its role in preventing the dominance of heavily populated states over smaller ones. This system ensures that candidates must appeal to a diverse range of states, considering the unique needs and concerns of citizens across the nation. Abandoning the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote might lead to a situation where candidates primarily focus on densely populated urban areas, potentially neglecting the interests of citizens in less populous states.

While the popular vote system is often heralded as more democratic, it is important to address the potential drawbacks and counterclaims associated with such a shift. Critics argue that the Electoral College can lead to scenarios where a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the electoral vote. However, instances of this happening are rare, as highlighted by [Author]. Furthermore, efforts like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact aim to address this concern by maintaining the state-by-state structure of the Electoral College while ensuring that the winner of the national popular vote secures the presidency.

It is crucial to recognize that the United States is a diverse nation with varying regional interests. The Electoral College serves as a mechanism to balance these interests, preventing the marginalization of certain demographics or geographic regions. The Founding Fathers designed this system to foster inclusivity and ensure that the President represents the entire nation.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College is not flawless, it plays a vital role in upholding the principles of our democracy. It provides a fair and balanced approach to presidential elections, considering the interests of all states. As your constituent, I respectfully urge you to carefully consider these arguments in the ongoing discussions about the electoral system. I believe that retaining the Electoral College is essential for preserving the integrity and fairness of our democratic process.

607,1,"The electoral College is something in the United States that needs to be replaced. It is an irrational system that takes the people's power to vote away from them. The system has flaws that leave the possibility of disaster open to happen. It takes the power to choose the government officials from the people, and gives it to a group of people who can vote either way. Why would we keep this?

The electoral College is a way to choose the Presidential candidate who wins the election. It involves a slate of electors according to Source 2 who cast their votes in. The people in each state vote for the winning electors of that state. The electors pledge to a candidate and thats what people vote for. Once the people choose a winning elector group they go to Congress and cast their votes in for who they want, and that person then gets so many votes. The problem is that the electors aren't required to vote for who they said they would, so if the elector suddenly decided to change his mind after he or she won, the people's votes are basically invalidated and a different elector gets the votes. This effectively removes the people from the equation in who gets elected. All an elector would have to do is win over the people, then he or she could just change their minds and cast a different vote than what they said they were going to do. The people who vote don't even vote for the Presidential candidate in this system, they vote for a bunch of electors that they hope will vote for what they said.

This is not an irrational, unrealized fear. It has actually happened before. According to Source 3, in the 2000 election, Al Gore had a majority of popular votes, but less electoral votes, so he lost to Bush. This isn't even the first time it has happened, it has happened previous times throughout U.S. history. This is a clear example of how flawed the electoral College system. Between the possibility of the people's votes not counting for anything, and that they don't even actually vote for their preffered candidate, this system needs to be replaced.

Some may argue that the chance of an elector not casting his or her vote that he pledged to is very slim. Why would you even be ok with taking such a chance? It's better to be onehundred percent sure of what will happen instead of ninetyfive percent. Also, since most states in the U.S. award electoral votes by a winnertakesall basis according to Source 3, if one side of the votes wins, even by a slim margin, they get all the votes. This seems unfair, since if they won by a slim margin at least some of the state thinks it should be a different vote. It would make more sense if the states awarded both sides of the vote if it was a close win for one side or the other, but they would award the true winner with more votes than the narrow loser.

Another problem with the E.C. system is that states that are largely of one belief Republican or Democrat ect. have no real reason to pay attention to the opposite side of the canidacy. Since the state would be largely one thing or the other, it is irrelivant if thirty percent of the state votes one way if seventy percent of the state votes the other, since the landslide victory style of electoral vote giving is present in most states. This also means that states that are biased and small states get almost no exposure from the opposite side of the canidacy because they know they have almost no chance of winning their votes. This seems to force the voters to choose one candidate's electors because they don't know enough about the other.

In conclusion, the electoral College needs to be replaced with a more fair, balanced system. It has the potential to allow the electors to defy the will of the people who voted them in, invalidating the people's votes and making them pointless. It also has candates only focusing their ads and visits on the states with more votes and the states biased towards their party. Finally, it has almost all the states have a landslide ""winnertakes_all"" style of awarding electoral votes. This means if one side of electors only wins by a slim margin, the other side gets nothing, even though since they lost by a small number they clearly have a sizeable amount of voters for them. The electoral College needs to be removed before someone takes advantage of it's serious flaws and takes the votes of the people and makes them useless.",0,"the electoral College be something in the United States that need to be replace it be an irrational system that take the people 's power to vote away from they the system have flaw that leave the possibility of disaster open to happen it take the power to choose the government official from the people and give it to a group of people who can vote either way why would we keep this 

 the electoral College be a way to choose the presidential candidate who win the election it involve a slate of elector accord to Source 2 who cast their vote in the people in each state vote for the win elector of that state the elector pledge to a candidate and that s what people vote for once the people choose a win elector group they go to Congress and cast their vote in for who they want and that person then get so many vote the problem be that the elector be n't require to vote for who they say they would so if the elector suddenly decide to change his mind after he or she win the people 's vote be basically invalidated and a different elector get the vote this effectively remove the people from the equation in who get elect all an elector would have to do be win over the people then he or she could just change their mind and cast a different vote than what they say they be go to do the people who vote do n't even vote for the presidential candidate in this system they vote for a bunch of elector that they hope will vote for what they say 

 this be not an irrational unrealized fear it have actually happen before accord to source 3 in the 2000 election Al Gore have a majority of popular vote but less electoral vote so he lose to Bush this be n't even the first time it have happen it have happen previous time throughout U.S. history this be a clear example of how flawed the electoral College system between the possibility of the people 's vote not count for anything and that they do n't even actually vote for their preffered candidate this system need to be replace 

 some may argue that the chance of an elector not cast his or her vote that he pledge to be very slim why would you even be ok with take such a chance it be well to be onehundred percent sure of what will happen instead of ninetyfive percent also since most state in the U.S. award electoral vote by a winnertakesall basis accord to Source 3 if one side of the vote win even by a slim margin they get all the vote this seem unfair since if they win by a slim margin at least some of the state think it should be a different vote it would make more sense if the state award both side of the vote if it be a close win for one side or the other but they would award the true winner with more vote than the narrow loser 

 another problem with the E.C. system be that state that be largely of one belief republican or Democrat ect have no real reason to pay attention to the opposite side of the canidacy since the state would be largely one thing or the other it be irrelivant if thirty percent of the state vote one way if seventy percent of the state vote the other since the landslide victory style of electoral vote give be present in most state this also mean that state that be biased and small state get almost no exposure from the opposite side of the canidacy because they know they have almost no chance of win their vote this seem to force the voter to choose one candidate 's elector because they do n't know enough about the other 

 in conclusion the electoral College need to be replace with a more fair balanced system it have the potential to allow the elector to defy the will of the people who vote they in invalidate the people 's vote and make they pointless it also have candate only focus their ad and visit on the state with more vote and the state bias towards their party finally it have almost all the state have a landslide winnertakes_all style of award electoral vote this mean if one side of elector only win by a slim margin the other side get nothing even though since they lose by a small number they clearly have a sizeable amount of voter for they the electoral College need to be remove before someone take advantage of it be serious flaw and take the vote of the people and make they useless"

Emissions from cars create greenhouse gasses, which are detrimental to our environment, and limiting the use of our cars can greatly cut down these emissions. Also, many people say that using alternate modes of transportation cut down on the stress they experienced whilst using a car. In fact, many people are no longer concerned with cars, and young people are beginning to stop getting licenses.

1390,0,"Limiting car usage can lead to a myriad of advantages for individuals and communities alike, fostering environmental sustainability, improving public health, and creating more livable urban spaces. By shifting away from the dominance of cars on our roads and embracing alternative modes of transportation, we can address pressing issues and work towards a more harmonious and sustainable future.

One of the foremost advantages of reducing car usage lies in its positive impact on the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) highlights that vehicular emissions are a significant contributor to air pollution, leading to severe health risks and environmental degradation. By limiting the number of cars on the road, we can curtail air pollution, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. This reduction in environmental harm is essential for the well-being of both current and future generations.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can significantly improve public health outcomes. The American Public Health Association underscores the negative health impacts of sedentary lifestyles associated with car dependency. Encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling, not only reduces air pollution but also promotes physical activity, thereby contributing to a healthier populace. With the prevalence of health issues like obesity and cardiovascular diseases on the rise, a shift towards more active forms of transportation becomes imperative.

Furthermore, limiting car usage contributes to the creation of more livable and sustainable urban spaces. The Urban Land Institute emphasizes that car-centric urban planning often leads to traffic congestion, noise pollution, and a lack of green spaces. By prioritizing public transportation, cycling infrastructure, and pedestrian-friendly initiatives, cities can enhance the quality of life for their residents. Walkable neighborhoods, efficient public transit systems, and accessible green spaces create communities that are not only healthier but also more socially connected.

Moreover, limiting car usage aligns with global efforts towards smart and sustainable urban development. Many cities worldwide are investing in comprehensive public transportation systems and embracing initiatives like bike-sharing programs. These efforts not only reduce the environmental footprint of urban areas but also contribute to the creation of resilient and efficient cities that can adapt to future challenges.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a holistic solution to address environmental concerns, improve public health, and enhance urban living. By incorporating alternative transportation methods into our daily lives, we can collectively contribute to a more sustainable and harmonious future. It is incumbent upon citizens to recognize the multifaceted advantages of reducing car dependency and actively support initiatives that promote a shift towards more sustainable transportation practices.",1,"limit car usage can lead to a myriad of advantage for individual and community alike foster environmental sustainability improve public health and create more livable urban space by shift away from the dominance of car on our road and embrace alternative mode of transportation we can address press issue and work towards a more harmonious and sustainable future

297,0,"Last year in 2014, the earth had the warmest temperature in recorded history. Needless to say, this is due to greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide. One of the major reasons behind an increase in greenhouse gases is due to the use of cars and motorcycles, which release high amounts of carbon dioxide. It is to our benefit that we prevent any form of unnatural climate change on earth, and the most effective way to execute this is by living a more ""carfree"" life, especially here in the United States as it is our second most contributing factor of our increasing greenhouse gases. America could follow the path that many other countries and cities took.

In Vauban, Germany, cars have been banned unless one should decide to buy a permit in the form of a public garage. Most citizens take other means of transportation than cars. They walk, use bicycles, or public transportation. This has resulted in Vauban having a much cleaner environment and less stress as a result of no traffic. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" confesses Heidrun Walkter. Building suburbs like Vauban would result in a lower production of air pollution and a much more stress free environment.

Bogota has a similar policy as Vauban, but only lasts one day of the year. However, that only serves the citizens to be more enthusiastic about the event. Most people were glad to help out in anyway to reduce the smog. Bogota has also inspired other cities to do the same. Cali and Valledupar also decided to encourage this ecofriendly day. A day might not be much out of three hundred and sixty four, but a small contribution from a large mass of people can make a huge change. Implementing this same policy in more cities and countries would result in a notable change in the amount of air pollution around that time of year.

Paris resently executed a policy to ban cars with oddnumbered plates on Tuesdays as a consequence from a heavy smog that was brewing for several days. Paris had a smog of higher concentration than London, having 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter while London only had 78.7. There were residents who were unhappy with the ban, but the benefits the city gained from it were outstanding. Traffic was down by 60 percent and and as a recompensation for those who could not use their cars, public transportation was free from Friday to Monday. Due to the dedication of the mayor and citizens, the smog cleared up enough for the ban to be lifted. Making this a something a whole nation can participate in would definately improve the annual greenhouse gas emmssions.

Limiting car usage can have a posotive heavy impact on the world as a whole if more people were to follow the examples of these cities. The year of 2014 was known as the hottest year in recorded history, and it undoubtedly has to do with how much greenhouse gasses we emmited.

2020,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: An Analysis of Global Experiences

The transformation of the auto-centric culture is currently under way across many regions in the world and it is essential to understand the potential benefits of limiting car usage. Various global experiences, such as those of Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; Bogota, Colombia; and the USA, offer valuable insights into this topic. The advantages of minimizing car usage range from environmental benefits to enhancing the quality of life in communities.

In Vauban, Germany, 70 percent of families have relinquished car ownership in favor of an ecology-centric lifestyle (Rosenthal2, 3). The absence of cars leads to a significantly quiet and safety-enhanced community environment, particularly beneficial for the children (Rosenthal3). The focus on smart planning, where suburban life is separated from auto usage, reflects a burgeoning trend that wishes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal4, 5).

Several cities have seen the urgent need for limiting car usage, often due to extreme pollution problems. Paris, for instance, imposed temporary driving bans, which led to reductions in congestion by 60 percent (Duffer10, 14). This example is a tacit testament to the immediate environmental benefits achievable by reducing car usage. Similarly, Bogota, Colombia, hosts an annual car-free day to foster a culture of alternative transportation methods, bringing the added benefit of improving city air quality (Selsky20, 24).

Outside Europe and South America, America is also witnessing a progressive decline in car usage and a shift in citizen behavior (Rosenthal29, 30). The rise of telecommuting, urban renewal, and flexible commuting arrangements compounded by technology are leading to a cultural shift (Rosenthal35). A concerning decrease in the percentage of young people getting a driving license has also been observed, signaling the potential for a more lasting trend of diminished car usage (Rosenthal38). Reduced car usage comes with benefits beyond the environment, including saving commute time and resources, and promises improved safety and well-being (Rosenthal43).

However, these transformations may have implications for car manufacturing industries which now see the need to rebrand as “mobility” companies (Rosenthal34). Ford’s initiative to create a network of various transportation modes, interweaving pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, and public transportation, demonstrates an essential strategy crucial to this changing landscape (Rosenthal43).

In conclusion, the transition to limiting car usage holds significant potential benefits. These include a serene environment, improved safety, reduced air pollution, and potential health benefits through cycling or walking. Moreover, it also creates a strong foundation for cities to embrace a sustainable future by mitigating carbon emissions. These global experiences underline the importance of strong policy-making, technology-driven solutions, and community participation to combat the challenges posed by a car-dependent society. As the world moves further into the 21st century, the need to balance our transportation choices between convenience and sustainability becomes ever more pressing.",1,"title the advantage of limit car usage an analysis of global Experiences

117,0,"Imagine getting off work on a Friday at five o'clock, there's no bumper to bumper traffic, no horns honking at each other, and no stressful commutes home. This is unimaginable for people who reside in the U.S., but people in parts of Europe live like that every day. There are many advantages to cutting down on car usage.

One advantage to this cut would be that you would be saving money. Many people who drive tend to get in accidents or get pulled over by police for speeding. These incidents are very costly and come with repercussions if you don't pay them. Another way you would be saving money is not having to pay for gas. Gas may be only 2.00 for now, but when those prices go on that incline again it becomes very costly to fill up the tank. If you can't afford to fill up your tank then you will be putting wear and tear on the car which leads to more more money being spent to maintenance it. Alternate transportation that's more cost efficient is taking the city bus. It costs about 1 to get from point A to point B where it would cost you about 6 in gas to get you to the same place. You could also purchase a bicycle to take you where you need to go. Maintnancing a bike is a lot cheaper than a car.

A second advantage that limiting car usage has is that it eliminates pollution. A car gives off sound, light, and air pollution which all effect our ecosystem whether you notice it or not. The U.S may not have as much air pollution as other countries but with the increase in car purchases it could get worse. I'm not saying youn have to completely get rid of your vehicles, but maybe the license plate bill may work. Every other day only license plates that begin or end with odd numbers could drive, and on the days the odds can't drive we allow the plates with the even numbers to drive. People could car pool with coworkers on the days that whoever has those plates can drive. We just need to start taking percausions on our car usage.

In the car free test cities people are overall happier because they aren't so stressed worrying about being late due to traffic or getting in an accident. Driving can be extremely stressful especially with the many things that can distract people so easily. These distractions can lead to accidents or just more stress.

1997,0,"Title: Reducing Our Dependence on Cars: A Path to a More Sustainable Future

Cars have transformed the world by providing advantages such as freedom of movement and convenience. However, as our understanding of global climate change develops, it is clear that reducing automobile dependency offers considerable benefits. As evidenced in Vauban, Germany and similar communities worldwide, limiting car usage can lead to healthier, safer, and more sustainable communities.

Vauban, a suburb on the outskirts of Freiburg, offers a unique model of a car-free lifestyle (Rosenthal, “In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars”). Vauban residents have embraced this model, with 70% of families not owning cars and 57% having sold a car to move there. This car-free community model offers several benefits, like improved social interactions, healthier lifestyles, less noise, and overall, a more peaceful environment.

Moreover, limiting car usage contributes significantly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Through careful urban planning and development suitable for walking and public transportation, such as seen in Vauban, the significant environmental impacts of cars can be substantially reduced.

In addition to environmental benefits, reducing car usage can also address health issues related to pollution. In Paris, the French government enforced a partial driving ban due to near-record pollution levels caused primarily by car emissions, and the air cleared remarkably after five days of the ban (Duffer, “Paris bans driving due to smog”). This example illustrates immediate advantages in improved air quality that can be achieved through restrictions on car usage.

Furthermore, a shift in behavior towards less dependence on cars is already appearing in the United States and elsewhere. This is facilitated by internet technology, renewals in city centers, and innovative commuting arrangements as discussed by Drexel University Sociology Professor Mimi Sheller (Rosenthal, “The End of Car Culture”). A key demographic shift in the decreasing percentage of 16- to 39-year-old drivers suggests a trend towards less car usage. 

In conclusion, the time is ripe for communities worldwide to consider reducing their dependence on cars. Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating better living environments, and facilitating the shift towards alternative modes of transportation are all compelling reasons to limit car usage. It's essential for people to reassess their relationship with cars and consider the benefits of adopting sustainable transportation solutions. 

The movement to limit car usage requires citizens to question long-standing conceptions about personal mobility and embrace more sustainable habits not only for their personal benefit but also for the collective benefit of the planet. Through commitment and dedication, the extracted benefits from reshaping our car culture can lead us to a healthier, quieter, cleaner and more sociable future. It's not about completely eliminating cars from our lives, but rather developing a balanced and sustainable relationship with them.",1,"title reduce our dependence on car a path to a more sustainable future

1182,1,"Dear state senator, The electoral college is an unfair and irrational, and should be abolished immediately. The fact that the race for president can end in a tie is completely absurd. Also the fact that popular vote can mean basically nothing is dumbfoundidng. In a country of democracy popular vote seems like a it would be standard. popular vote seems like the best idea when it comes to a country for the people.

The electoral college is highly unfair to voters. Presidential candidates dont even have to visit all of the states to win the elections. The representation that the smaller states get is unfair. Presidential candidates will only visit states with a high number electoral college representatives because the states are known as ""swing states"". Swing states greatly influence the outcome of the election because they can hold the most power. If a state such as texas with 34 electoral votes was to have the same amount of power as a state with a much smaller population than the electoral college would seem much more viable.

The electoral college state representatives do not have to vote with that states popular vote. Al Gore, in the 2000 presidential election, won the popular vote but still lost the electionPlumer 9. The fact that a candidate can win the vote of the people but still lose the election is horrifying. How can you trust a system that works against what the United States of America is about. It completely takes away the right of people to decide what goes on in there government. The fact that the electoral college state representatives do not have to vote with people is highly unfair.

There is one crucial flaw in the electoral college, the election can end in a tie. In 1976 a tie would have occurred if just 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other wayPlumer 12. If we were to switch to a system were all states including the District of Columbia get one vote then the election could never end in a tie. Although this still seems highly unfair to the voters because the representative could go either with or against the popular vote the election could still never end in a tie solving the amjor flaw. What was to happen if we did have a tie? It has not yet been desided because it never has happened and that is a major problem.

The electoral college is highly unfair and should be disposed of immediately. The electoral college is biased towards the larger states,has major flaws that can only be fixed by getting rid of the system and does not give a fair view of what the people want. The system was poorly thought out and needs to be replaced.

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College intact as the method of electing the President of the United States. While some argue that this system is outdated and undemocratic, I believe that it serves important purposes that should not be overlooked. In this letter, I will outline the reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be preserved, addressing counterclaims and providing evidence from multiple sources.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Due to the winner-take-all system used by most states, even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral-vote victory. This system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of prolonged legal battles and disputes over the results of the election.

Another crucial benefit of the Electoral College is that it requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as outlined by Judge Posner. No single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to voters across different regions. This results in a president who is more likely to represent the interests of all Americans, rather than just those of a specific region. It also ensures that residents in all regions feel enfranchised and have a stake in the election process.

The Electoral College also maintains the importance of swing states, as highlighted by Judge Posner. In an election, the candidates focus their campaign efforts on these swing states since they hold the key to victory. This approach encourages voters in these states to pay close attention to the campaign, making them more thoughtful voters. By allowing swing states to have a significant impact on the election, the Electoral College ensures a more engaged and informed electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a balance of power for big states, as mentioned by Judge Posner. Despite the mal-apportionment of the Senate, where small states have an equal number of senators as large states, the Electoral College ensures that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates. In a campaign, a candidate is more likely to invest time and resources in a large state with a significant number of electoral votes. This helps to ensure that the concerns and needs of citizens in larger states are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the necessity of run-off elections, as argued by Judge Posner. Run-off elections can significantly complicate the presidential election process. By providing a clear winner, the Electoral College avoids the need for such run-off elections and ensures a smoother transition of power.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidates have no hope of winning, it is important to note that voter turnout is not solely determined by the election system. In the 2012 election, approximately half of the eligible American population voted, despite the fact that no single vote swings a national election. People who participate in presidential elections typically have a desire to express their political preference rather than expecting their vote to decide the outcome. The Electoral College does not diminish the significance of voting but rather maintains the balance between regional and national interests.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves important purposes that should be considered before any decision to change the election system is made. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the influence of big states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. The arguments against the Electoral College are based on assertions that lack a strong basis in reality, as argued by Judge Posner. Therefore, I urge you to consider these factors and support the preservation of the Electoral College in our democratic system.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my views into consideration when deliberating on the future of our election system.

Sincerely,

927,0,"I remember thee stories my dad use to tell me about how in cuba he would have to walk 6 miles to get to school. Or when he got here theat to work he would ride his bike to & from work. Cars are being put into use for no reason, people now a days go in thee car to to thee winn dixie theats right across thee street. Do you know how much money is put into cars? you have to pay for gas, or if your car breaks down or has a leak. Cars are a huge investment and theey are very dangerous to our society, thee pollution cars cause i horrendous. Now don't get me wrong I would prefer to go in a car on a 3 hour ride to Orlando from Naples, i mean who would want to walk 1000s of miles? but to get in thee car to get dropped off at school when you live 5 minutes away? theats ridiculous.

In Germany car use has been dropping and it has proven to provide a cleaner environment, healtheier living and huge savings. Near thee French and Swiss borders, it is forbidden to have hoe garages, street parking and drive ways. The streets are considered to be carfree zone. There are a few streets theat cars are allowed, you can park in a larage car garage or at thee edge of a development. But thee parkng space is not free thee parking space in 40,000, along withe a home. Obviously theat price is alittle bit pricey for people so 70% of theeses families do not own cars and 50% acctually sold a car to be able to live theere. The environmental Protection Agency is strongly trying to promote reducing cars andor car usage all theroughout thee united states.

What comes to your head when you theink about Paris? love, romance, coffee shops, expensive dinners on thee effie tower. How about pollution, having to stay inside because thee healthe concerns? Paris has recently banned driving due to thee pollution revolving the city of love. Motorists ere requested to leave theeir cars at home or suffer a 31 dollar fine, to some people thee 31 dollars did not effect theem so theey kept driving and were fined. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had theere cars impounded due to inappropriate reaction to recieving theis fine. After 5 days of what frances citizens would call torture 60% of congestion was down, believe it or not Paris was rivaling Beijing, China known for having one of thee most polluted streets in thee world! The blame was put on diesel fuel, 67% of frances cars use diesel engines. Paris has moresmog thean otheer european capitals like london or brussels. Imagine how much clearer Paris would be if theis car ban lasted a year!

Imagine how nice it would be to have zero traffic, no rush to get home. but how would you feel if thee reason behind theis traffic free day you had to ride a bike or go on thee bus? you would probably take theat traffic over a little exercise or having to stand next to a stranger. In Bogota, Colombia thee have a event called ""a carfree day"" in theis day colombians all gatheered as theey skated, biked or rode thee bus to get to theeir destination. If you violated theis you would have to fance a 25 dollar fine. The goalpf theis even was to promote alternative transportation but to also hope for less smog. During theis day not even rain could stop theese colombians from participating in theis event. Some people saw theis as a save thee world act also to relieve stress.

Cars are a way to travel long distances and should be used every once in a while but thee world is asking you please put an end to theis, use of cars for every little theing, start to set a goal to live a happier healtheier life and create a safe eviorment by ending car use, Start small like riding a bycicle to thee grocery store, theen decide to take a walk to thee neighbors right around thee street.",0,"I remember thee story my dad use to tell I about how in cuba he would have to walk 6 mile to get to school or when he get here theat to work he would ride his bike to from work car be be put into use for no reason people now a day go in thee car to to thee winn dixie theat right across thee street do you know how much money be put into car you have to pay for gas or if your car break down or have a leak car be a huge investment and theey be very dangerous to our society thee pollution car cause I horrendous now do n't get I wrong I would prefer to go in a car on a 3 hour ride to Orlando from Naples I mean who would want to walk 1000s of mile but to get in thee car to get drop off at school when you live 5 minute away theat ridiculous

490,1,"Presidential election is held every after four years on the first Monday of the month November. We decide who's going to be our next leader, the President. Electoral College is kind of unfair for some people because they think that whoever got the most popular vote should be President. But to think, what if the people we vote to is not right to be the next President and shehe got that most popular vote? Wouldn't that be a disaster? I say we should keep the Electoral College.

Electoral College process in consists of the electors that have been selected by the people. The ones who got selected are the ones with great intelligence and with great sense of leadership. In the first passage it mentioned that ""The Electoral College has a total of 538 electoras and the majority of electoral votes are required to have 270 electoral votes."" This means that for you to be one of the candidates you atleast have to have 270 electoral votes and this is a good way of picking our candidates to run for us for President.

Remember the election between Obama and rodney? It was close but, not that close. Our President, Obama got 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and Romeny. Almost of every states electoral votes is on a ""winnertakeall"" basis. For every slight of plurality in each of the states, it creates a ""landslide electoralvote"". This means that a tie would be possible because the number 538 votes is uneven but, it's mostly not to happen and this is because of Electoral College.

Electoral College avoids the problem of which didn't receive a majority of the votes. In passage three it gave an example about how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent only in pluraity of the popular votes and the winning number of the Electoral College is 301 and 370 electoral votes. Because of Electoral College the pressure that happens in electing the next President to lead us for four years is reduced and it also tells us which is the winner of the election.

If we elect our President using popular votes it migh be a disaster. Because not all of the candidates are that great of leading the whole country and If heshe got selected to be our next leader for the next four years our country would be in a huge chaos. I slightly agree with electing that person and making himher the next President because they got the most popular votes but, then again I don't think it's the right way of picking our new leader.",0,"presidential election be hold every after four year on the first Monday of the month November we decide who be go to be our next leader the President Electoral College be kind of unfair for some people because they think that whoever get the most popular vote should be President but to think what if the people we vote to be not right to be the next President and shehe get that most popular vote would n't that be a disaster I say we should keep the Electoral College

1209,0,"Cars, they make life so much easier, or, do they make them deadlier? The amount of green house gasses has increased dramaticly over the past years, due to the gasses emitted through the tallpipes of cars. However, there has been ways that people are trying to lower these gasses. People around the world are reducing the use of cars for a more cleaner form of transportation. In Vauban, Germany residents in this community ""have given up their cars""1. Also in Paris where they ""enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air""10. While in Bogota, Colombia they have a car free day to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog""20. These cities are pioneers in the way of a cleaner form of travel.

The first step is to just have a day without cars, like a new holiday. In Bogota, thats just what they have. On this day ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work""20, and those who didn't were fined. This reduces not only smog but the stress of driving and the business of traffic jams. On one of these carfree days, even though it was raining the spirits of the people didn't dampen. Enrique rivera, the mayor of Asuncin, Paraguay, said ""these people are generating a revolutionary change and that it is crossing borders""26, when he visited Bogota. As a result of these days ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restraints and upscale shopping districts have cropped up""28.

Another way that the carfree idea is shaking up is in Paris, France. On a Monday ""motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home""11, if they didnt they would recieve a 22euro fine. There smog riviled Beijing, ""known as one of the most polluted cities in the world""14. however, after only one day, ""the smog cleared enough on Monday that the ruling French party rescinded the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday""19.

The biggest leap, however, would be a town with no cars. Vauban, Germany is a community where ""street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden""2. The streets are filled with ""the swish of bicyles and the chatter of wandering children""3 instead of motors and horns. This expirimental town has sparked a new way of life a cleaner, safer way of life.

711,0,"Cars are an integral part of many peoples lives around the world: they provede transportation to work and home, they cater to social lives, and for some they even provede a home.

However, it's becoming a trend to limit car usage, particularly in Europe. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up cars almost completely, with the exception of a 40,000 parking garage fee that over half of the residents have elected not to use.

While it may make getting places harder, the effects of cutting down on car usage are mostly good ones.

First and foremost on this list is global warming. In Europe, cars produce around twelve percent of greenhouse emissions, while in the US, the number can be as high as fifty percent in cities. This is not good. Global warming is destroying the ice caps and the ozone layer of Earth, leading to a temperature increase that is damaging many environments around the world. This, in addition to pollution released by cars and the oil industry, could permanently cripple our planet. Any way that we can cut the effects of global warming should be implemented.

Secondly, crowded cities benefit in many ways from a lessening of driving. Some cities, like Paris, have already had to enact a partial ban on driving due to a heavy smog layer. Other cities, like Beijing, is even more polluted, and cities in this country suffer as well. If less people drove, the air would be clearer, as was the case in Paris.

Also, there is less crowding when less people are driving. Anyone who has driven through or lived in a large city knows just how bad congestion and traffic jams can be. Less driving would mean less congestion, making it easier for people to get to work, school, or other locations on time. When Paris enacted its driving ban of those with evennumbered licence plates, congestion went down sixty percent.

1067,1,"Dear senator, We should change the electoral college to an election by popular votes for the president of the united states.

I believe that everyone should have a say in who their future president should be not just a group of selected officials. Sure some of the peoples choices may end up bias or thoughtless but atleast they get to feel as if their a part of the state. like stated in ""what's wrong with the electoral college"" sentence 11 ""Those electors could always defy the will of the people."" meaning that sometimes the chosen electors neglect their positions and use it the wrong way. The selected electors may end up going against the people andor choose a bias decision. No matter how you look at it their still human and they will make mistakes.

Electoral votes should be abolished because it isn't justified for all of those hardworking citizens who always pay their respects to this country. It even states in ""what's wrong with electoral college"" sentence 14 "" It's official : The electoral college is unfair ,outdated, and irrational."" meaning that the electoral college has been here long enough, it's not justified ,and it's irrational. Something like that should no longer exist. The citizens should have a say in who will become their new president. They should have a majority vote.

1324,1,"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a ""winnertakeall"" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficial to the outcome of the election because it makes the ability for a candidate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president"", states that ""even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state..."" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"", Source 2, argues that a term called disaster factor', or the possibility of imminent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in louisiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, ""faithless"" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are starman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a ""winnertakeall"" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, ""..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.."", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The ""winnertakeall"" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that ""The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests..."", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves.",0,"the Electoral College have be establish since the founding of our country it be a system that have be try and test to work over the course of century it should be uphold for it be ability to produce a solid outcome and though it have the possibility of fail it be fault be not bad than the popular vote system and that the Electoral College foster a presidency campaign that appeal to multiple region of the United States this fair system allow representation of the people 's will just like the rest of our government do

561,0,"Cars have been used as the main means of transportation for a long time now, but just because we have counted on it for such a long time doesnt mean there are not better ways. There are a ton of advantages for limiting car usage. Lower emissions, conserving resources, and it make us more healthier are just some of the reaons ways that limiting car usage will improve our daily lifestyles.

To begin with, one of the advantages of limting car usage is improved emissions. Today cities all around are poisoning people with toxic air, cars being the main contributers. But it doesnt have to be this way, some cities are doing things to change. In Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear up the global city. Also in Bogota, Columbia has made a difference by incorporating a yearly Day Without Cars. One day out of the entire year is not going to clear up the global air quality but it does opens peoples eyes up to alternative ways of getting around without the use of cars. A businessman even reported that it is a good opportunity to take aways stresses. For the first time, two other Columbian cities have joined in on the event. All of this just proves that cars arent the only way.

In addition to lowering emissions, another advantage of limiting car usage is it would conserve resources. Think about how many cars are in the world. THERE ARE ALOT! So every car in the world uses resources to keep it running, even electric and hybrid cars eventhough they are a great alternative. But most use fossil fuels. The world doesnt have a unlimited supply of fossil fuels. It took millions of years t make the gas we put in our cars. So eventually we will run out and when we do it will take a very long time to get it back. Also think about the generation of people after us. What will we leave behind for them?

Lastly, limiting the use of cars will improve our heath. Before the invention of cars most of the population who walk. Eventhough it would take longer to get from place to place it will benefit use also. American, sadly, is probably the laziest county in the world. You rarely see people walking or riding a bike to and form work on a daily basis eventhough in real busy cities you probably would get to and from work faster cause you wouldnt have to wait in the morning or evening rush hour. Its also ceeper than using your cars, you are going to spend a rediculous amount of money on gas in a year, so think it will help the environment and your wallet.

A study last year has showed that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe we are the generation to make the change to other ways of getting around, advantages being lower emissions, conservation of resources, and a healthier you. So just remember the next time you have ot go to the store, just take a bike.",0,"car have be use as the main mean of transportation for a long time now but just because we have count on it for such a long time do nt mean there be not well way there be a ton of advantage for limit car usage low emission conserve resource and it make we more healthy be just some of the reaon way that limit car usage will improve our daily lifestyle

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of whether to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from multiple sources, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained. Although there are valid counterarguments for changing to a popular vote, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, ensures that every region is represented, encourages candidates to focus on swing states, gives weight to larger states, and prevents run-off elections.

One of the key reasons to maintain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. While disputes over the Electoral College vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes in most states, where even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory, reduces the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to campaign across the country and appeal to diverse regions. This prevents candidates with only regional appeal from being elected and ensures that every region feels represented.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. In a close election, candidates concentrate their attention on the states that are most likely to determine the outcome. This leads to increased voter attention and engagement in those states, as voters feel that their votes will have a significant impact on the election. The thoughtful and informed voters in swing states should be the ones to decide the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance to the political weight of large states. Due to the malapportionment of the Senate, large states have less influence in the political process. The Electoral College provides a platform for presidential candidates to pay attention to larger states, as winning a large state garners more electoral votes compared to winning a small state. This ensures that the concerns and interests of residents in large states are not disregarded.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections. With the Electoral College, a candidate who wins a majority in the Electoral College becomes the clear winner, regardless of their plurality in the popular vote. This eliminates the possibility of prolonged election procedures and complications that would arise from run-off elections.

While it can be argued that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the overall impact is minimal. The turnout in presidential elections is already high, with about half of the eligible American population voting. Voters participate to express their political preferences rather than in hopes of swinging a national election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be maintained as it provides certainty of outcome, guarantees representation for every region, encourages candidates to focus on swing states, gives weight to larger states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote, the benefits of the Electoral College outweigh those arguments. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.

Subject: The Importance of Preserving the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of electing the president by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides important advantages that should not be dismissed.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As mentioned in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely compared to a dispute over the popular vote. This minimizes the chances of a prolonged election crisis and ensures a definitive result.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes a candidate with trans-regional appeal. This method requires a presidential candidate to have support from various regions, ensuring that the president represents the entire nation. As Judge Posner explains, candidates with only regional appeal are unlikely to be successful presidents, as residents from other regions may feel disenfranchised and believe that their interests are not being prioritized. The Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across different states and engage with voters from diverse backgrounds.

Additionally, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These are states where the outcome of the election is uncertain and can swing either way. By doing so, candidates are compelled to pay attention to issues that matter to voters in these states. This ensures that voters in swing states receive more attention and information from the candidates, allowing them to make more informed choices.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a balanced representation for both large and small states. As highlighted in Judge Posner's article, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the disproportionate apportionment of the Senate. By granting more electoral votes to larger states, presidential candidates are encouraged to address the concerns and needs of these states. This ensures that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account during the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections in the event that no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This simplifies the election process and avoids potential complications that may arise from run-off elections. By providing a clear winner, the Electoral College ensures that the will of the people is accurately represented.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented in Bradford Plumer's article ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" it is important to consider the practical benefits that come with this method of electing the president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances the representation of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These advantages are crucial for ensuring that the president elected is representative of the entire nation. Therefore, I urge you to consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

2049,0,"Title: Limiting Car Usage: The Key to a Sustainable Future

Our society is increasingly grappling with complex issues such as environmental degradation, population densification, traffic congestion, noise, and pollution. Car-centric lifestyles contribute significantly to these issues, and this essay aims to reveal the advantages of limiting car usage based on the evidence from multiple passages.

The case study of Vauban, a community in Germany, presents an insightful model of a deliberate shift from a car-dependant suburb to a thriving, car-free community (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb""). The experiment resulted in reduced car ownership, improved air quality, and the reclamation of public spaces. The sentiment expressed by a resident that the absence of cars contributed to her happiness signifies an improvement in residents' quality of life (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb""). The Vauban example comments on the broader movement known as 'smart planning,' underlining the essence of integrating sustainability into suburban life.

Such benefits are paralleled in Paris's case, where a temporary driving ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and significant improvement in smog reduction (Duffer, ""Paris bans driving""). Moreover, a regular 'Day Without Cars' in Bogota, Colombia, highlighted the benefits of alternative transportation, reducing smog and fostering community participation (Selsky, ""Car-free day"").

Furthermore, Rosenthal, in her article ""The End of Car Culture,"" discusses trends in American behavior showing a decrease in car purchases and driving, which indicates a cultural shift away from car dependence. This trend can lead to fewer carbon emissions, making an important contribution to global efforts against climate change. A by-product of this development could lead to the redesign of cities and communities to accommodate the reduced need for cars, potentially unleashing creativity in urban design.

Advancements in technology, underlining the rise of 'mobility companies' and the growth of shared transport systems, demonstrate the multiple solutions that are growing in response to the lessening dependence on car culture (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture""). These developments do not only present environmentally sound solutions, but also improve communal ties, and offer economically viable transportation alternatives.

However, as different cities are at different stages of development with unique societal and infrastructure complexities, the comprehensive reduction of car usage needs to be contextually adapted. Paris, for instance, witnessed some complaints from delivery companies during the driving ban (Duffer, ""Paris bans driving""). Thus, careful planning and inclusive discussions with stakeholders will be key to the successful reduction in car use.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous benefits, such as a healthier environment, reduced congestion, improved quality of life, and greater socioeconomic inclusivity. It's a step towards a sustainable future that may be inevitable, given the environmental challenges we face. The transition, even though complex and challenging, is viable and necessary, as captured by the successful experiments in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota. These examples serve as inspiring reminders that the movement towards less car-dependent societies not only contributes to sustainability but also enhances our quality of life.",1,"title limit car usage the key to a sustainable Future

0,0,"Cars. Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.

In like matter of this, article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.

Likewise, in the article, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.

In conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.",0,"car car have be around since they become famous in the 1900 when Henry Ford create and build the first modelt. car have play a major role in our every day live since then but now people be start to question if limit car usage would be a good thing to I limit the use of car might be a good thing to do

2167,1,"Dear Senator [Your Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to propose an examination and discussion about the process for electing the President of the United States. I believe the question at hand is whether we should continue with our current Electoral College system or transition towards direct election by popular vote.

The Electoral College, created by our founding fathers, is at the heart of our democratic process as laid out in the Constitution. As you are well aware, it consists of electors from each state who cast votes in line with their respective state's popular vote choice. As Judge Richard Posner rightly points out, our current Electoral College provides a degree of certainty in the election’s outcome, and ensures every state, regardless of its size, has a say in the choice of President (Posner, para 17 & 18). Its state-by-state system encourages presidential candidates to gain a broad, trans-regional appeal, thus making them everyone’s President. (Posner, para 19).

However, while the Electoral College has its merits, it also has significant drawbacks. The fact that electors can technically ignore the popular vote and cast their votes as they see fit can potentially disenfranchise voters (Plumer, para 11). Furthermore, the winner-takes-all system discourages candidates from campaigning in so-called ""safe"" states, arguably neglecting the interests of those states' residents (Plumer, para 13).

For every argument preserving the Electoral College, there seems to be an equally valid point for its abolition. Indeed, Bradford Plumer asserts that it is an ""unfair, outdated, and irrational"" system of choosing our President and highlights instances where the popular vote winner did not secure the presidency (Plumer, para 14). 

I would argue that gradual reform rather than complete abolition may be the way forward. The ideas of Maine and Nebraska, which have adopted a system of proportional representation in electoral votes, might be worth exploring on a more extensive scale. Such a system could provide a more accurate reflection of the popular vote while maintaining the benefits pointed out by Judge Posner, such as ensuring trans-regional appeal and preserving the certainty of outcome.

No system is perfect, but continuous improvement is the key to progress. As such, I kindly ask that you consider bringing discussion around reforming our Electoral College system to the floor of the Senate.

Thank you very much for your time and for your continued dedication to our state and country.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and the method by which we elect the President of the United States. After careful consideration and analysis of various perspectives, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained rather than changing to a popular vote system. 

Firstly, the Electoral College preserves the certainty of outcome and reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results. As is evident from past elections, the winner of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring a conclusive result. For instance, in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, whereas he only obtained 51.3% of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in most states also contributes to a landslide electoral victory and mitigates the possibility of a nationwide tie. This certainty is crucial in maintaining stability and confidence in our electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the presidential election. No single region possesses enough electoral votes to secure a victory, requiring candidates to appeal to a diverse range of voters across multiple states. This trans-regional appeal is vital in selecting a president who can effectively represent the entire nation. If a candidate can only win by dominating a single region, it is unlikely that they will be able to address the needs and concerns of citizens in other regions. The Electoral College helps prevent the potential disenfranchisement of voters and promotes a more balanced representation.

In addition, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These states, where the election outcome is uncertain, receive the most attention and resources from candidates. This ultimately benefits voters in those states as they become more engaged in the political process, actively listening to and analyzing the policies put forth by competing candidates. The swing states, with their thoughtful and engaged voters, should rightfully play a significant role in deciding the election and shaping the future of our nation.

The Electoral College also provides a safeguard for the political balance between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, gives more weight to smaller states in the political process. The Electoral College helps restore some equilibrium by allocating electoral votes based on population size. This ensures that presidential candidates must consider the concerns and issues faced by both large and small states, preventing a disproportionate focus on less populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. The system invariably produces a clear winner, avoiding the complexities and uncertainties associated with run-off elections. This streamlined process contributes to the stability and efficiency of our electoral system.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, statistics show that approximately half of eligible Americans still participate in presidential elections. Voters engage in the political process to express their political preferences, irrespective of the possibility that their vote may swing a national election. 

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains the most practical and effective method to elect the President of the United States. It provides certainty in outcomes, ensures the consideration of every region, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is imperative that we maintain this system to preserve the stability, fairness, and representative nature of our democracy.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I write to you as an informed citizen and student, currently diligently exploring the complexities of our political system. A key area of particular interest and contention is our use of the Electoral College in determining our president. After significant research and deliberation, I am writing to advocate for the retention of the Electoral College. 

The Electoral College, as posited by the Office of the Federal Register, was a compromise devised during our nation's formation, expertly straddling between election by Congress and popular vote. This unique system means vote-counting disputes are less likely given that the ""winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" (Posner). Any disputes that might arise are on a state level rather than across the entire nation, which contributes to a more certain outcome.

Judge Richard A. Posner points out multiple practical reasons for the Electoral College's retention, one of the most noteworthy being the necessity for presidential candidates to have transregional appeal. This ensures that no single region can elect a president, promoting equity among the diverse regions of our country and making every president ""everyone's president"" rather than a regional preference. 

Admittedly, Bradford Plumer brings up valid concerns in his article, such as the potential disregard of states where candidates feel assured of their victory, thereby focusing only on “swing” states. However, as Posner counters, voters in such swing states become the most informed and invested in the campaign, effectively becoming the thoughtful decision-makers necessary in such a significant selection process.

While it is true the Electoral College is not democratic in the modern sense given electors directly elect the president and not the people, it is vital to note that it ensures the president has broader geographical support, preventing a regional candidate from assuming office (Posner). This ultimately upholds the principle of federalism and maintains a balance of power.

Moreover, the Electoral College sidesteps the issues of run-off elections in instances when no candidate receives a majority of popular votes. Consequently, the process invariably produces a clear winner, thereby avoiding the complications associated with run-off elections (Posner).

Therefore, though there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, it seems prudent to retain it while simultaneously acknowledging its potential shortcomings. As citizens, let us remember the words of Judge Posner that ""voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference,"" not just individuals seeking to swing an entire national election. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to seeing your work in preserving and improving our great state.

1994,0,"The shifting culture around car usage, as discussed by various sources, presents a picture of a future where limiting car usage is not only advantageous but perhaps even inevitable. This essay explores some of the key benefits of reducing dependency on personal vehicles, as highlighted by a multi-city experience in Europe, Colombia, and the United States.

Firstly, Rosenthal's discussion of the German suburb of Vauban paints a vivid picture of a car-light society (Passage 1). In Vauban, 70% of residents have chosen to live without a car, thanks to a city model that welcomes pedestrians and restricts vehicle ownership and usage within the city. This creates a less stressful and quieter environment, as residents are not constantly burdened by the tension that comes with owning and maintaining a car. Furthermore, Vauban’s streets are almost entirely car-free, fostering a safe and serene atmosphere (Passage 1).

Aside from the evident lifestyle benefits, limiting car usage contributes to an important global cause- reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As Rosenthal underlines, passenger cars account for 12 to 50 percent of these emissions varying by geographical location (Passage 5). Therefore, a decrease in personal vehicles usage, as seen in Vauban, can significantly contribute to the combat against climate change. 

Even on a temporary basis, a limitation on car usage has shown positive results. In Paris for example, a partial driving ban was enforced due to near-record pollution levels. As a result, smog congestion decreased by 60% (Passage 14). This demonstrates how targeted initiatives to limit car usage can significantly improve air quality in a relatively short span of time, thereby creating healthier living conditions in urban areas. 

A similar approach was undertaken in Bogota, in the form of a car-free day (Passage 20). This policy encouraged alternative transportation methods, reducing air pollution while simultaneously promoting healthier options such as biking or walking. 

Rosenthal also speculates that a wider societal shift is currently underway in the United States, with people buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses (Passage 29-31). This cultural shift, driven by various factors - the Internet and telecommuting, urban living appeal, and flexible commuting arrangements, among others - is projected by some to continue into the future (Passage 35). 

In conclusion, limiting car usage confers numerous advantages. It can contribute to the improvement of our mental well-being, urban air quality, and climate health. Furthermore, the emergence of car-light communities and a possible cultural shift in attitudes toward owning cars signal a sustainable and responsible future. Nonetheless, necessary infrastructural changes and public policies should be instituted to further encourage this shift and guide our world towards a more sustainable future.",1,"the shift culture around car usage as discuss by various source present a picture of a future where limit car usage be not only advantageous but perhaps even inevitable this essay explore some of the key benefit of reduce dependency on personal vehicle as highlight by a multi city experience in Europe Colombia and the United States

89,0,"Nearly everyone in the United States has a car, if they're of age. Many people would probably argue that they need cars. How else would you get somewhere? Well, there are plenty of alternatives to driving, and other ways to just cut back. Limiting car usage has become rather popular recently. Even though there are some disadvantages from limiting car usage, there are so many more advantages that are extremely beneficial.

Pollution has always been a big problem almost everywhere in the world, and cars have a huge influence on it. Pollution can affect people's health and damages the environment. In Paris they put up a partial driving ban to clear up horrible smog. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" Source 2. It only took one day of a driving ban to clear up the smog. Imagine how much less pollution there would be if people limited driving for multiple days, even maybe weeks, or months? It's not like you have to permanently give up driving, just limit it when you can.

Limiting car usage can also help reduce stress levels and make you happier. It might sound crazy at first because, well how would you get places? Wouldn't that cause more stress? Vauban, a city in Germany, is a city that ""forbids"" parking, driveways, and houses with garages. They strategically put stores and buildings within an idealistic walking distance. ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two"" Source 1. If a working mother can do it, so can you. When you're always inside and juggling your kids and their needs, you'll most likely be tense and always feel busy. When you have no other option, besides paying over fourty grand for a space in a parking garage, than to walk somewhere, you'll get to be outside and experience socialization and the fresh air. In my opinion that sounds way better than being confined to a little car when you have to go somewhere.

Obviously there are uncountable benefits that come from limiting car usage. I don't know about you, but honestly I would prefer limited car usage. Until someone takes action to start making it easier to access places we would normally need our car to get to, limiting car usage is not going to be easy.",0,"nearly everyone in the United States have a car if they be of age many people would probably argue that they need car how else would you get somewhere well there be plenty of alternative to driving and other way to just cut back limit car usage have become rather popular recently even though there be some disadvantage from limit car usage there be so many more advantage that be extremely beneficial

541,1,"As stated in the article, the Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors, where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. A state's entitled number of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional Delegation. There is one for each member in the House of Representatives, and two for every Senator. There are many reasons why the voting process should be changed to popular vote instead of the Electoral College. The two biggest reasons are as follows: Unfair elections and the freedom of the people.

As stated in the third source, the Electoral College is often considered an anachonism and is unliked across the nation. The reasons for which vary greatly from certainty of outcome to big states to swing states. Certainty of outcome means that one of the Presidential Candidates has to be chosen to become President. There are no recounts in Electoral College, whoever they like the most becomes President, and that ins't fair to the people. Bigger states tend to have more members in the electoral college. This can greatly influence an election if a big state like Texas favors one candidate over the other. Swing states are the states that receive more attention than other states due to bias, greatly influencing votes. In my opinion, this is something that needs to be changed.

Citizens of the United States of America are the ones who are supposed to decide who should be the President of the United States of America. It isn't right to select a few people from each state to decide who the President will be. That power lies with the people, and nobody should be able to take that away. The votes of millions and millions of people are outweighed by the votes of a few hundred men and women. This is unjust and unfair in every way. If all the people in the United States wanted somebody as President, but the Electoral College disagreed, the Electoral College would win. Why should the Electoral College have more power than all of the people of the United States they shouldn't. The power to decide who is President of the United States of America should always lie with the good citizens that live here.

I hope that the voting process will change. I hope that it will finally become fair. That it will become what the people want it to be. It should be what the people want it to be. We the people of the United States have the power to change this, and we should work to change it. The voting process should no longer be the Electoral College but should be dicided by the people and only the people.

820,1,"Our country, the United States of America, needs and deserves a grand president who will work hard and inspire the citizens of this country to persevere like our forefathers have and this president needs to be voted by popular vote by hisher citizens in the United States. The presidential elections need to be of popular vote and to be voted by the citizens of America, not by some electoral college. The reason for this is that for one: the candidates ignore the smaller states, two: electors who are chosen can, and possibly will, go against the will of the people the Electoral College shows signs of inequality amongst the states, unpatrioticism, and unfairness.

If we continue to go by the electoral college, the smaller states who hold inadequate populations will continue to be ignored by the candidates running for presidency. In source 1 paragraph No. 3, it states:""Your states allotment of the electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives and 2 for your Senators."" Also, in paragraph 13 of Source No.2, it states,"" Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" So, the candidates ignore the smaller states because of their smaller population and this is a sign of unfairness and inequality amongst the people of America. The future president should address and obtain votes that are from all 50 states of the United States. That is how we treat and show that every person and every state are equal to one another, and that the candidates get an honest and fair vote. The way the Electoral College does things during the presidential election is everything against how our country came to be through hardwork, a desire and wish to be equal to one another, and to ensure fairness amongst the people this Electoral College projects an unpatriotic feel and that itself should not be a process that the United States holds.

The Electoral College is unfair in the fact that the electors chosen by our state legislature can, and possibly will go against the will of the people. With the Electoral College those who vote aren't actually voting for the president but for a slate of electors that elect the president. In Source No.2 paragraph 11, it states: ""In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" This is unfair and a disrespect to a persons choice. It is an act that is untrustworthy and it could happen at any time, people might not even know it. That action practically takes away a citizens right of opinion speech which is part of the Bill of Rights, the very basis of what we have a right to have. That in itself is unAmerican and unpatriotic. This system should be overruled and abandoned for it doesn't go with the basis of our country's ways.

However, the Electoral College does have a somewhat strict rule that is rarely broken. In Source No.3 paragraph 16, it states:"" But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for that party's nominee and that trust is rarely broken.."" The Electoral College does have some points that it is not totally untrustworthy. But, this point can be broken and can be unfair for the people.

Senator, I hope these points have shown that the Electoral College needs to be voted against due to its unfairness, unpatrioticness, and its act of inequality amongst the states. This country needs it's people to vote for it's president, not a slate of electors.",0,"our country the United States of America need and deserve a grand president who will work hard and inspire the citizen of this country to persevere like our forefather have and this president need to be vote by popular vote by hisher citizen in the United States the presidential election need to be of popular vote and to be vote by the citizen of America not by some electoral college the reason for this be that for one the candidate ignore the small state two elector who be choose can and possibly will go against the will of the people the Electoral College show sign of inequality amongst the state unpatrioticism and unfairness

324,0,"Fellow citizens cars are dying out. Every year more and more people are realizing the cultural and natural impact that cars are having on us in a negative way. There are many advantages that come with eliminating cars from society. For one reason is that we can start to eliminate roads and highways and use that land for houses or something else. Another reason is that it will help the world out in a natural way to stop temperatures from sky rocketing to completely melting the polar cap, and prevent smog from building up in dense cities. citizens also wont have to spend money on fuel or a car anymore and can save money.

As soon as citizens completely wipe out the use of cars then lot of positives will result out of it. As soon as cars are out of the picture then societies can use up the space from highways and roads to make houses and shopping centers that are walking distance from those houses or living communities. When people need to drive long distances to get to another destination thats far away from where they live then they can take theyre car thats on the outskirts of the city in a protected garage, just like they do in Vauban, Germany, they do this in order to keep the city within completely safe and pollutants free from cars.

Up to now and ever since the invention of automobiles like buses and cars the world has changed dramatically in temperature. Earth has become like a microwave just trapping heat from the Greenhouse effect which causes the carbon dioxide from the cars to stay in earth and not expell to space which has caused some of the highest temperatures in the last 100 years. With the elimination of cars less carbon dioxide will be let out causing the eart to cool and thus will help save the polar ice caps. Not only will it save the cold areas of the world but it will also help reduce smog in densely packed cities like Paris and binging. Up to now cities like Paris and Bogota have had certain days where they prohibit the use of cars in the city to help and calm the smog down. This Method has helped dramatically and it was only for one day! Imagine what doing this forever can do for the environment.

Another topic for eliminating the use of cars is the economic change it will postively have on the environment. For one families wont have to spend money on gas. Second they wont have to spend money for a car. Last but not least third they wont have to spend money on tolls or tickets. So simply if you dont have a car you wont have to worry about any of those problems.

737,0,"For years, the United States has been mass producing and using cars. It may sound surprising, but America has already reached its peak when it comes to buying cars source 4. More and more people around the globe have begun to realize the benefits of using alternative means of transportation. Places such as Vauban, bogota, Paris, and even New York have implemented programs to encourage the limited use of cars. The idea of giving up such a comfort may sound tragic at first, but reducing car usage has many advantages.

We use cars everyday for pretty basic purposes. To get to work or school or to run errands are just a few examples. Now, imagine what would happen if a car were not available to you. It probably would not be the end of the world. You could catch a bus or ask for a ride from somebody. If you really needed to, you could even ride your bike or walk to wherever you needed to go. People in the past tended to fear using alternative transport, for varying reasons. Maybe friends or family are not willing to give rides. Maybe the sheer thought of walking a mile may seem terrifying or ridiculous. The most common reason is probably that having a car is just too covenant, it seems that there is no need for any other way of transportation! But life can and should be adjusted to fit into these sources of transport. In Vauban, Germany, for example, residents have given up their cars in favor of a life without them source 1. I just proves that contrary to popular belief, cars are actually not a necessity!

Citizens in Vauban, Germany walk or ride bicycles when they need to go someplace source 1. It's almost needless to say this, but they have a much healthier lifestyle than most carowners in the United States! They are not afraid of walking or riding a bike a bit to get where they need to. Not only are these people in better physical shape, but one mother, Heidrum Walter, tells us that when she had a car, she was always tense, but now that she has given it up, she seems happier source 1. Carlos Arturo Plaza, in bogota, Columbia, says that using his bike on their annual nocar day reduces his stress levels. There is a direct corrolation between physical activity and mental wellbeing. The more activity, the better you feel. By limitting car usage, we are also encouraging the physical exercise that comes in place of it, making us a happier, healthier community.

Maybe the most important reason to reduce car usage is to protect our enviroment. By obtaining and burning fossil fuels, we are both running out of this resource and posing the threat of spills and air pollution to our environment. The gasoline we use to fill our cars certainly won't last forever. It won't even last for much longer at the rate we are burning it at. Also, spills can be devasting to the ecosystem it impacts, as we have seen in the past, for example the BP oil spill. Perhaps the biggest disadvantage to the gasoline we use to fill our cars is the air pollution it leaves behind. Transportation is the second leading source of emissions in the US, behind power plants source 4. Also, in Paris, the smog from automobiles got to be so bad that they set laws to ban cars on certain days source 2. Just by reducing car usage for a few days, the smog cleared tremendously. It wouldn't be hard at all for each individual in this community to cut back on the amount of time they spend driving in their cars, if for no other reason than to keep our Earth clean.

Over the years, we Americans have grown accustomed to relying on cars for our every need, but we can't do that anymore. As a community, we need to open our eyes and see the changes happening around us. Cars are not a necessity. We don't even need to completely get rid of them, but it is neccesary for us to cut back, for the sake of our health and our environment. It may take some getting used to, but I promise, it is more than possible. In the words of Bill Ford, we can soon move forward to a world where ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve saftey."" source 4.",0,"for year the United States have be mass produce and use car it may sound surprising but America have already reach its peak when it come to buy car source 4 More and more people around the globe have begin to realize the benefit of use alternative mean of transportation place such as Vauban bogota Paris and even New York have implement program to encourage the limited use of car the idea of give up such a comfort may sound tragic at first but reduce car usage have many advantage

360,0,"Numerous amount of people would love to experience the opportunities of limiting their time with their car. There are a great amount of advantages of limiting car usage. Advantages include having a more healthy environment, decreasing stress, and reducing traffic.

The advantages of limiting car usage is helping the environment. ""passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" While most of the adult population is driving cars everyday, more gas and smoke go into the air and into our environment. This causes pollution and hurts our environment. Paris has a major smog problem in their environment, up to the point where it was nearrecorded. Paris had to then enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. The effect of this ban was that congestion was down 60 percent and the smog cleared after a short week. If we were able to limit our car usage, then our greenhouse gas emissions would decrease. ""In the United States, the environmental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities, and legislators are starting to act."" There are numerous environmental agencies that are already starting to act to decrease the car usage in the country. We should limit our car usage because it can greatly help our environment.

If were able to limit our car usage, then it will greatly decrease our stress of driving. Many countries are trying to reduce car usage. An example is Columbia. Columbia has created a carfree day. ""Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses during carfree day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Bogota, Colombia have practiced this day for three years and many colombians have been pleased with it. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Plaza. Without driving, you have the time to go out, be active and get exercise. A huge effect of the car free day is that park and sport centers have been built all throughout Bogota, smoother sidewalks, and rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. With car usage reduced, it limit people's stress on driving.

If we were able to lower the number of car usage, then our streets would be much safer and there would be less traffic. Many people use cars today and because of that most of streets are usually blocked up. If there were less cars on the streets then it would be easier and quicker to go to places. Vanban, Germany is an example of an carfree town. ""...basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls alond some distant highway."" With less cars on the streets, it can also reduce car accidents and deaths. If there were less cars on the roads, there would be less traffic and car accidents.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of whether or not to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for the following reasons: certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power for big states, and avoidance of run-off elections.

Firstly, the certainty of outcome is a crucial aspect of the Electoral College. Unlike in a direct popular vote system, the electoral vote winner almost always reflects the winner of the popular vote. This provides a sense of legitimacy to the electoral process and reduces the likelihood of disputes. While there have been cases like the 2000 election that were contested, these situations are rare and do not outweigh the benefits of the Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal and does not solely represent specific regions. Due to the requirement of winning a majority of electoral votes, presidential candidates must campaign nationwide and consider the interests of all regions. This prevents a candidate from focusing solely on densely populated areas or regions where they have overwhelming support, and promotes a more balanced representation of the entire country.

Thirdly, the emphasis on swing states is a positive attribute of the Electoral College. In a system where each state's electoral votes are determined by a winner-take-all principle, candidates are encouraged to campaign in swing states. This increases voter engagement and attentiveness, as these states play a critical role in deciding the outcome of the election. It ensures that these states receive more attention and consideration from candidates, thereby deepening the democratic process.

Fourthly, the Electoral College allows big states to maintain some political weight in the selection of the president. While the Senate's mal-apportionment may skew political power in favor of smaller states, the Electoral College balances this inequality. By allocating electoral votes based on the number of representatives in the House of Representatives, big states receive proportionally more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that their concerns and issues are adequately addressed.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process. Since the winner is determined by securing a majority of electoral votes, there is a reduced likelihood of having no candidate receive a majority in the initial election. This feature of the Electoral College guarantees a clear and decisive winner, preventing the need for additional rounds of voting and potential political turmoil.

While critics argue that the Electoral College does not provide fairness or adequate representation to all voters, I would counter that the system is designed to be pragmatic and effective. It serves as a compromise between a direct popular vote and a vote in Congress, reflecting the wisdom of the founding fathers. Additionally, it prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas, leading to a more balanced representation of the diverse interests and concerns of the entire nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an integral part of our democratic process and should be retained. It provides certainty of outcome, guarantees representation for all regions, promotes voter engagement in swing states, balances the power of big states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. I respectfully urge you to consider these points when deliberating on any potential changes to the electoral system.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will take these arguments into account and make an informed decision that best serves the interests of the American people.

Subject: Support for the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in the election of the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of a direct popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that contribute to a fair and balanced democratic process.

Firstly, the Electoral College system was established as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and electing the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, as outlined in the Constitution. This compromise ensures that the interests of both individual citizens and states as sovereign entities are taken into account. The Electoral College strikes a balance by giving each state a voice in the election based on its representation in Congress, thereby preventing larger states from effectively silencing the concerns of smaller states.

Additionally, the Electoral College guarantees that the outcome of the presidential election is certain, preventing potentially divisive and protracted disputes. As evidenced by the 2000 election, where the popular vote winner did not secure the presidency, a direct popular vote system could lead to disputes and challenges that undermine the stability of our democratic process. The Electoral College, on the other hand, ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always surpasses their share of the popular vote, providing a clear and accepted outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters and regions. With the winner-take-all distribution of electoral votes in most states, candidates have an incentive to campaign and address the concerns of voters in a variety of states, rather than solely focusing on heavily populated metropolitan areas. This ensures that candidates engage with a diverse range of citizens and understand their needs, leading to a more representative and effective presidency.

Additionally, the Electoral College reinforces the political balance between large and small states. Under a direct popular vote system, candidates would be more likely to concentrate their campaigns in highly populous states, potentially disregarding the unique challenges and opinions of citizens in smaller states. By giving each state a proportional number of electoral votes based on its representation in Congress, the Electoral College ensures that smaller states have a voice in the presidential election and encourages candidates to consider their concerns.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections, which can complicate the presidential election process and perpetuate uncertainty. Runoff elections, as seen in other countries, can be costly, time-consuming, and often fail to produce a clear winner. The Electoral College, by design, eliminates the need for runoffs and consistently produces a single, decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, while not perfect, provides a fair and balanced process for electing the President of the United States. Its representation of states' interests, certainty of outcome, promotion of broad appeal, support for political balance, and avoidance of run-off elections are crucial to our democratic ideals and the strength of our nation. I respectfully urge you to consider these points and support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your dedicated service and for considering my perspective on this matter. I look forward to your continued leadership and support.

624,1,"The electoral college is not a good thing and it certainly messes things up it takes votes away from people, It changes the votes to make a person lose presidency even by changing the senators, and it's a winner take all system these dont turn out good no matter what. It's even overthrowing the people with the popular vote yes it sadly is possible.

Why would you still have the electoral college if it doesnt help anyone at all?

There are many many ways to win an election and this is not one good way it can easily make one side lose even if they won the popular vote. The odds of one side winning is easily changed with electoral votes. This interrupts the odds of how much the people likes them then it turns into how much the government of states likes them. However it could help some people win if they are not the popular vote.

It can also make anyone with the popular vote lose when they should have won like after Al Gore during the gallop poll thanks to the perks of the electoral college won the popular vote but he lost presidency over it. Even though 60% of people prefer the direct election now some prefer the electoral college.

But this can all be due to the fact that the electoral system was made by our founding fathers on the Constitution so it may only be natural that they support it. A good argument was when the system allowed for far worse when the electors for defy the will of people like in passage 2 it says ""in 1960 when segragationists in the louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing electors who would oppose John F. kennedy"" that is just evil. Although the law has not been changed since the Constitution was made.

Even at the most basic level the electoral college is still unfair to voters because of the winner take all system put in place for each state. They saddly dont visit every state in passage 2 it says ""Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have 0 chance of winning, focusing only on tight races"" Although the winner take all is made just to do what they are using it for by awarding electors to the presidential candidate exept for Maine and Nebraska it is being used for what they are using it for.

In all the electoral system is not good but its not all bad it takes the votes away from the people,Its a winner take all system, and its taking people down who deserve to win even changing the senators to make them win. Its evil and makes no sense to what they are doing trying to give other parties a chance i get it but its gone a little to far.",0,"the electoral college be not a good thing and it certainly mess thing up it take vote away from people it change the vote to make a person lose presidency even by change the senator and it be a winner take all system these do nt turn out good no matter what it be even overthrow the people with the popular vote yes it sadly be possible

1473,1,"I am writing to share my perspective on the ongoing debate regarding the Electoral College and the potential transition to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. This issue is of paramount importance to our democratic process, and after careful consideration of various viewpoints, I find myself advocating for the preservation of the Electoral College.

One of the primary virtues of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 68, is its role in preventing the dangers of direct democracy. By requiring candidates to secure a majority of electoral votes from diverse states, this system promotes a broad national appeal. The Electoral College acts as a safeguard against the tyranny of the majority, ensuring that candidates must consider the interests of citizens across a variety of regions and demographics.

Critics often point to instances where the winner of the popular vote did not secure the presidency, like the 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush. While this may seem like a flaw in the system, it is essential to consider the counterargument that the Electoral College encourages candidates to build coalitions that transcend regional boundaries. Without this system, candidates might focus exclusively on populous urban areas, neglecting the concerns and needs of citizens in less populated states, as noted by George C. Edwards III in his analysis of the Electoral College.

However, I acknowledge the valid concerns raised by those advocating for a popular vote system. The argument that the Electoral College can lead to outcomes where the popular vote winner loses the election challenges the core democratic principle of one person, one vote. It is imperative to address these concerns while maintaining the strengths of the current system.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College is not without its imperfections, it plays a crucial role in fostering a balanced and nationally representative democracy. As you deliberate on potential reforms, I encourage you to consider the delicate equilibrium the Electoral College maintains, preventing the undue influence of specific regions while promoting a broad national consensus. Any proposed changes should aim to enhance the fairness and representativeness of our electoral system without sacrificing the system's foundational principles.",1,"I be write to share my perspective on the ongoing debate regard the Electoral College and the potential transition to a popular vote system for elect the President of the United States this issue be of paramount importance to our democratic process and after careful consideration of various viewpoint I find myself advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College

2104,1,"Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health amidst all your public service work. I am writing to you as a concerned citizen to express my opinion on the validity of our current Electoral College. 

The founding fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and the presidential election via a popular vote of qualified citizens. Each state's entitlement of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation, giving a fair representation to the population sizes of each area. The safety of our democracy relies on the stability of this construct and the assurance that the path to presidency requires broad geographical appeal.

Judge Richard A. Posner argues five practical reasons to continue with the Electoral College system: certainty of outcomes, inclusive representation, attention to swing states, balanced focus on both large and small states and avoidance of run-off elections. I echo his sentiments and believe that the Electoral College is crucial for a fair election. For instance, it helps avoid disputes over vote outcomes as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College often exceeds his share of the popular vote, thereby creating a clear winner.

Yet, critics like Bradford Plumer question the fairness of the Electoral College, pointing to its potential for catastrophe and the disproportionate focus on ""swing"" states at the expense of others. While I acknowledge these cons, a shift towards direct elections could amplify these issues, with candidates focusing on heavily populated urban regions, dismissing the unique concerns of less populated rural areas. 

To address the “swing state” argument, Judge Posner states that focusing on swing states is beneficial as these voters will have received the most presentation and attention, allowing them to be more informed in their decision making. I support this assertion as it empowers voters in these states to move beyond party lines and choose a candidate based on the candidate's policies and positions.

Regarding the counterclaims of faithless electors, indeed it can be a serious issue, but it is important to remember that such instances have been exceedingly rare in history. Since it is the duty of each state to decide punitive actions against faithless electors, I suggest a legislation at the state level to ensure electors are bound to vote for their party's candidate and face severe penalties for not doing so.

While I understand the call for a direct popular vote, America's vast size, diversity, and complex identity make the Electoral College a logical and effective institution for electing our nation's president. Ultimately, the balance offered by the Electoral College and its benefits can outweigh the disadvantages. 

Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I truly believe that preserving the Electoral College system will ensure that our future elections are fair, representative and decisive.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my position on the matter of the Electoral College and its continued existence or potential replacement by a popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments presented in various texts, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained. In this letter, I will present my claim, address counterclaims, provide evidence from multiple sources, and avoid over-reliance on a single source.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of electors, the voting process by electors for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. Each state's allotment of electors is based on its Congressional delegation, ensuring fair representation (Passage 1).

One counterclaim against the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic. However, it is essential to note that democracy does not always mean direct popular vote but can also include representative democracy. The electors, selected by the political parties, have a responsibility to vote for their party's nominee, ensuring that the will of the people is represented (Passage 15).

The first reason to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike in a direct popular vote system, disputes over the electoral vote outcome are considerably less likely due to the winner-take-all allocation of electoral votes in most states (Passage 18). This ensures a decisive result and reduces the possibility of extensive recounts or legal challenges, as seen in the 2000 election.

The Electoral College also serves as a means to ensure that the President has trans-regional appeal (Passage 19). No single region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to elect a President, thereby compelling candidates to campaign in various states across different regions. This requirement promotes a broader understanding of regional interests and prevents the disenfranchisement that would occur if a candidate campaigned only in the regions where they were already popular.

Furthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, where the election outcome is uncertain (Passage 20). By prioritizing these states, candidates must engage voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, have the final say in the election.

The Electoral College also restores some balance to the political influence of large states compared to small states (Passage 21). While the popular vote would allow candidates to focus solely on large population centers, the Electoral College system forces candidates to consider the concerns of smaller states and gives them disproportionately more attention in the campaign process. This ensures that the interests of citizens living in less populated states are not ignored.

Lastly, the Electoral College addresses the issue of run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner (Passage 22). This eliminates the need for the complexities and expenses associated with additional voting rounds. Through this system, the President who garners the most electoral votes is declared the winner, ensuring a decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College, including certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, swing states, balancing the political influence, and avoiding run-off elections, outweigh the counterarguments. The Electoral College provides a fair representation of voters' needs and interests while maintaining the stability and integrity of the presidential election process. It ensures that all states have a voice and that regions with diverse interests are considered.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will take into account the practical reasons supporting the retention of the Electoral College. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

 dear Senator Senator 's last name 

 I be write to express my position on the matter of the Electoral College and its continued existence or potential replacement by a popular vote for the President of the United States after carefully consider the argument present in various text I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retain in this letter I will present my claim address counterclaim provide evidence from multiple source and avoid over reliance on a single source 

 the Electoral College as establish by the found father serve as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizen it consist of the selection of elector the voting process by elector for the President and Vice President and the counting of electoral vote by Congress each state 's allotment of elector be base on its congressional delegation ensure fair representation passage 1 

 one counterclaim against the Electoral College be that it be undemocratic however it be essential to note that democracy do not always mean direct popular vote but can also include representative democracy the elector select by the political party have a responsibility to vote for their party 's nominee ensure that the will of the people be represent passage 15 

 the first reason to retain the Electoral College be the certainty of outcome unlike in a direct popular vote system dispute over the electoral vote outcome be considerably less likely due to the winner take all allocation of electoral vote in most state Passage 18 this ensure a decisive result and reduce the possibility of extensive recount or legal challenge as see in the 2000 election 

 the Electoral College also serve as a means to ensure that the President have trans regional appeal passage 19 no single region in the country possess enough electoral vote to elect a President thereby compelling candidate to campaign in various state across different region this requirement promote a broad understanding of regional interest and prevent the disenfranchisement that would occur if a candidate campaign only in the region where they be already popular 

 furthermore the Electoral College focus campaign effort on swing state where the election outcome be uncertain passage 20 by prioritize these state candidate must engage voter who be most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decision this ensure that the most thoughtful voter who have receive the most information and attention from the candidate have the final say in the election 

 the Electoral College also restore some balance to the political influence of large state compare to small state Passage 21 while the popular vote would allow candidate to focus solely on large population center the Electoral College system force candidate to consider the concern of small state and give they disproportionately more attention in the campaign process this ensure that the interest of citizen live in less populated state be not ignore 

 lastly the Electoral College address the issue of run off election by consistently produce a clear winner passage 22 this eliminate the need for the complexity and expense associate with additional voting round through this system the President who garner the most electoral vote be declare the winner ensure a decisive outcome 

 in conclusion the argument in favor of retain the Electoral College include certainty of outcome trans regional appeal swing state balance the political influence and avoid run off election outweigh the counterargument the Electoral College provide a fair representation of voter need and interest while maintain the stability and integrity of the presidential election process it ensure that all state have a voice and that region with diverse interest be consider 

 thank you for consider my viewpoint on this important matter I trust that you will take into account the practical reason support the retention of the Electoral College if you have any further question or require additional information please do not hesitate to contact I

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping it as the method for electing the President of the United States. While there are valid concerns and criticisms of the Electoral College, I believe that it plays a crucial role in our democracy.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the election results are conclusive and reduces the likelihood of disputes over the outcome. With the winner-take-all system, even a slight plurality in a state can result in a landslide electoral-vote victory, making the process more predictable and stable.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure victory. This means that candidates have to consider the interests and concerns of voters from different regions of the country. This results in a president who is more likely to represent the diverse needs and perspectives of the entire nation. It also prevents the possibility of a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected, ensuring that the president is a unifying figure for all regions.

The winner-take-all method and focus on swing states also contribute to the strength of the Electoral College. Candidates concentrate their campaign efforts on toss-up states, prompting voters in these states to pay closer attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. This system encourages thoughtful voting and makes it more likely that the most engaged and informed voters will decide the election, rather than a few swing voters in a direct popular vote.

Another crucial aspect of the Electoral College is that it provides an opportunity for smaller states to have a say in the election. As Judge Posner rightly points out, the Electoral College balances the political weight of large and small states, ensuring that presidential candidates give attention to citizens in states with smaller populations. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on heavily populated states and neglecting the needs and concerns of citizens in smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections by invariably producing a clear winner. This eliminates the complications and uncertainty that can arise when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. The Electoral College guarantees a decisive outcome, preventing prolonged and potentially divisive run-off elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, the high voter turnout in recent elections demonstrates that voters are motivated to express their political preferences regardless of the outcome. The Electoral College does not diminish the significance of individual votes but rather ensures that each state's voice is heard in the election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a critical role in our democracy by providing certainty of outcome, encouraging trans-regional appeal, focusing on swing states, balancing the influence of large and small states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections. It ensures that the president represents the diverse needs and perspectives of the entire nation while preserving the stability and integrity of the election process. For these reasons, I strongly urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I appreciate your commitment to serving our state and country.

46,0,"In order to dramatically reduce greenhouse gases, a new fad is being introduced all over the world. The fad is ways to make the world more ""carfree"" or ""carreduced"". This may sound shocking and to complicated to implement, but believe it or not, there are communities and cities that are already showing improvement with decreasing greenhouse gases that cars let off.

Vauban, Germany, is an upscale, fully functional experimental German suburb on the outskirts of Freiburg, without cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are not found in Vauban, the main form of transportation is a public tram that runs to downtown Freiburg. Heidrun Walter is a media trainer who lives in Vauban with her two kids, Mrs. Walter states, "" I am much happier this way"". Completed in 2006, Vauban is a an example of a growing European and United States trend that separates auto usage from suburban life. Everything that the 5,500 residents of Vauban could need is walking distance away, the community is built in a rectangular square mile with all of the stores on a main street.

Greenhouse gases from Europe contribute to 12 percent of all emissions, the United States is responsible for as much as 50 percent of these emissions. To most people, these numbers would be meaningless, but to the people of Paris, these number clearly showed with their smog covered streets. Paris hit a nearrecord pollution rate which caused the partial driving ban to take place. The partical driving ban in Paris was as follows on Monday, motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to not use their cars, or be forced to pay a fine, on Tuesday, the same instructions were put in place for oddnumbered plates, this ban continued throughout the week. While this did outrage some drivers, public transit was free of charge from Monday through Friday which did help drivers who were restricted.

A national ""Day without cars"" was Bogota, Columbia's way to incorperate car limitations. Millions of Columbian participants found alternative ways to get to and from work. Bogota has a total of 7 million citizens who were promoted to use alternative transportation and reduce smog. Despite gray clouds and random spurts of rain, Mayor or Bogota, Antanas Mockus said, "" The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" For a first time, during the previous national, ""Day without cars"" two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Rera, the mayor of Asuncin, Paraguay. Along with the ""Day without cars,"" Columbia has also put out rushhour restrictions, smoothed sidewalks, and cropped new resturants and upscale shopping districts.

All three cities have showed creative and functional ways to cut back on using cars, weather it be offering new ways to have a less complicated life in Vauban, Germany, limiting the number of cars that can drive on certain day in Paris, France, or creating a national holiday which encourages people to find alternative ways of transportation like in Bogoata, Columbia. It is clear that people in places everywhere are ready to make a change to cut down on greenhouse gases. The United States, as a whole has shown cutbacks on the number of vehicles and licenses being issued, in fact the amount of young people driving decreased by 23 percent from 2001 and 2009. Ultimately, the goal for the entire world is to conserve resources, lower emission rates of harmful greenhouse gases and improve safety, with the rate that cities and communities are going now, this goal without a doubt reachable.",0,"in order to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas a new fad be be introduce all over the world the fad be way to make the world more carfree or carreduce this may sound shocking and to complicated to implement but believe it or not there be community and city that be already show improvement with decrease greenhouse gas that car let off

930,0,"Limiting car usage has many advantages. The most important advantage is reducing pollution. Vehicles emit greenhouse gasses from their tailpipe. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse has emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"", as said in source one, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

One of the main reasons the pollution is so bad in Europe is because of the diesel fuels. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average in the rest of Western Europe. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114, and London had 79.7. The numbers show that there is a direct correlation between the percent of diesel used, and the amount of pollution in an area.

Limiting car usage also helps cities grow. In Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed. Along with parks and sports centers blooming up, side walks have been replaced. Even new restraints and shopping districts have been built. And on top of all this, traffic has been majorly reduced. As said in the exerpt, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , ""These people are generating a revolutionary change."" Not only does reducing the amount of cars help the environment, it's better for your health. Pollution doesn't only affect the environment, it also damages the body. As the air gets polluted by greenhouse gas emissions, you breath in that air. And that contaminated air is the same contaminated air that is being cycled throughout our body. On top of that, reducing the usage of vehicles would force you to find a new way to get to your destination. You might resort to walking, jogging, bike riding, skating, or anything else you could think of. Limiting car usage would force you to exercise, which is obviously very beneficial to one's health.

Another advantage of limiting vehicle usage is the money that would be saved. Limiting vehicle usage would result in not buying gas as often. And as expensive as gas can get, that would would be a lot of money saved. If you went as far as selling your vehicle, there's even more money that you would benefit from.

So there are many advantages that result from limiting vehicle usage. For one, it reduces pollution, which is bad for the environment, as well as our health. Secondly, it would force us to exercise more. And lastly it would save us a lot of money.",0,"limit car usage have many advantage the most important advantage be reduce pollution vehicle emit greenhouse gas from their tailpipe passenger car be responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse have emission in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive area in the United States as say in source one in German Suburb life go on without car

799,0,"Everyday when you wake up and get ready for work there's always one thing you use, it's inched it's way into your daily life and now you wouldn't be able to do most things without it. It's your four wheeled friend that sits out in your driveway or garage, your car. Every day millions of people drive miles and miles in a car, using them to go to work or to go and see other people, but what people don't understand is the need to limit just how much they use their automobile companions.

Cars have changed our lives for the better and for the worse. They save us a tremendous amount of time by making traveling super efficient, but along with that is air pollution. Cars emit greenhouse gasses, and these gasses trap heat which in then leads to warming of the surface of the earth. This warming of the earth creates drastic changes in many environments such as the polar regions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe... and up to fifty percent in some car intensive areas"" This was stated in an article about German suburb life without cars. By limiting the amount of which we drive and by switching to alternative sources for transportation we can lower the amount of greenhouse gases and stop the heating of the earth.

Furthermore, these gases create smog. Smog is similar to fog but instead it has gases emitted from cars in it. Smog is usually thick and can be hazardous to environments. It was so bad in Paris that they set a partial driving ban in which people couldn't not drive because they didn't want the smog to get worse. The problem here is that people still continued to drive out even though there was a ban being enforce. So, this is another issue in which cutting back on car uses can fix. If we switch to biking to places that are withing biking distance or walking to place that are walking distance than we wouldn't have to worry about smog, or bans.

Automobiles have changed the way we live our lives and the way we do things, but they also have changed our communities. The typical city today consists of tall buildings and a surplus of streets and avenues, but parks are not as common. In Bogota there has been celebrating a day without cars for three years, and it has seen changes in the community. By having everyone give up their car for a day it can change their view on things, can make them notice things about the place in which they live in that they did't know about before. It can show them the beauty of their surroundings and this can lead to people wanting to protect that beauty and improve their city. This can be done in the form of building parks, and fixing uneven sidewalks.

So all in all, we depend on cars for daily purposes and it may seem hard to let go of your keys and walk, but if we all do that every once in a while it can lead to tremendous benefits. Imagine if you could walk outside and see people walking and enjoying themselves, not having to worry about gas prices or traffic jams. Imagine if we didn't have to worry about greenhouse gases or smog. Going for walk instead of driving may not seem like much, but it has major impacts on a multitude of things.",0,"everyday when you wake up and get ready for work there be always one thing you use it be inch it be way into your daily life and now you would n't be able to do most thing without it it be your four wheeled friend that sit out in your driveway or garage your car every day million of people drive mile and mile in a car use they to go to work or to go and see other people but what people do n't understand be the need to limit just how much they use their automobile companion

2088,1,"Senator [Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I’m writing to share my thoughts on one of the foundational pillars of our democratic process - the Electoral College. Over time, the debate over its efficiency and fairness has created a significant divide between those who advocate for reform and proponents of the original system. It is a complex issue with arguments on both sides, but I believe it is critical to maintain the Electoral College as it serves several essential functions in preserving the integrity and stability of our elections.

The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise, balancing the power between Congress and the people in electing the President (Office of the Federal Register). This compromise ensures more equitable representation across states, particularly for smaller or less-populated states. Under the system, every state is allocated a number of electors equal to their Congressional delegation, allowing smaller states to have an impact proportionate to their size (Office of the Federal Register). 

Moreover, the Electoral College adds certainty to the election outcome and invariably produces a clear winner (Judge Richard A. Posner). An electoral dispute is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote, thanks to the “winner-take-all” system which creates a landslide electoral-vote victory even with the slightest plurality. This system prevents the complication of potential run-off elections in case no candidate receives a majority of the vote (Judge Richard A. Posner).

Critics claim that the system is undemocratic and unfair, suggesting a direct election instead. They argue the Electoral College allows for a possibility where a candidate could win the popular vote but fail to secure the presidency (Bradford Plumer). However, this occurrence is minimal, with only a few exceptions in the history of U.S. presidential elections (Judge Richard A. Posner).

Nevertheless, it is crucial to address the concerns raised by critics, particularly relating to fairness and representation. Some argue that the “winner-take-all” system discourages candidates from campaigning in states they are predicted to lose, limiting the election discourse to “swing” states (Bradford Plumer). This argument certainly holds weight and is something that should be considered in any discussions of reform.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite criticisms, is imperfectly perfect. Its pros outweigh the cons, ensuring regional representation, reducing the likelihood of electoral disputes, and importantly, eradicating the need for potentially divisive run-offs. 

Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider calls for reform to enhance the perceived fairness of the process. It is my hope that you will consider this perspective when addressing this issue in the legislature.

Sincerely,

1312,0,"""All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.

To start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of nearrecord pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.

Next, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay 40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih evennumbered license plates could drive one day and oddnumbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota's carfree day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.

To conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.",0,"all of our development since World War II have be center around the car and that will have to change say David Goldberg an official of Transportation for America David Goldberg say this in mean of try to decrease car usage such as in Vauban Germany car usage after World War II continue increase for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of mile drive start to decrease in the year 2013 the mile drive in the United States decrease nearly 9 since 2005 and be equal to the amount of mile drive in 1995 throughout the whole world people have be experience problem with air pollution and due to that many have be try to decrease the usage of car in different way to slow this air pollution 

 to start off pollution from car have be a large factor of the air pollution today in the United States 50 percent of the greenhouse emission in the United States be cause by passenger car then there be Paris who have be experience heavy smog recently it have have day of nearrecord pollution reason for such high level of smog or air pollution can be attribute to a tax policy that favor diesel over gasoline Diesel make up 67 of vehicle in France then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3 of the vehicle be diesel 

 next be how some people attempt to slow the car pollution the first example of a community try to decrease the usage of car be Vauban Germany in Vaubaun street parking driveway and home garage be generally forbid for the most part Vauban be car free the only way to use car in Vauban be to carpool because there be only two place to park in the whole city and they be two large parking garage on the edge of development then you have to pay 40,000 to keep a spot 70 of the people in Vaubaun do not own car Anoter example be Paris who be one of the big air pollutant next to Beijing they have be try to decrease the smog in their area through slow the amount of car on the road what they do be make it so only car wih evennumbere license plate could drive one day and oddnumbered license plate the next almost 4,000 driver be fine due to this policy which show some reluctance in follow the plan this do not matter though because the smog clear enough to where the polcy only last for one day another attempt in lower the usage of car be Bogota 's carfree day in this program it be quite obvious that it be just a day of no car usage at all during this event Colombians hike biked skated or take bus to work even in the rain people of Bogota participate in this event then there be one other case of lower the usage of car which be the natural way have people just grow away from the car this be currently happen in the United States one of if not the large car user like I say early since 2005 the usage of car have decrease whether this trend stay in motion or not depend on the idealism of the current and future generation

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to urge you to support its continuation. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and undemocratic, I believe that it serves an essential purpose in our presidential elections and should be preserved. In this letter, I will present several reasons why the Electoral College is beneficial for our democratic system.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in the presidential election. Unlike the popular vote, which can be disputed and subject to recounts, the Electoral College ensures a clear winner. As stated by Judge Richard Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote, creating a decisive victory. This eliminates the potential for prolonged disputes and uncertainty that could arise from a direct popular vote system.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the entire nation rather than just a few densely populated areas. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents candidates from solely focusing on large, populous states while neglecting smaller ones. This is crucial for maintaining a balanced representation and preventing disenfranchisement. As Judge Posner highlights, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president, and it is essential for the residents of all regions to feel that their votes count and that the president will represent their interests.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, thereby engaging voters and fostering a more informed electorate. Instead of concentrating solely on safe states or densely populated areas, candidates are compelled to address the concerns and priorities of voters in swing states. As a result, voters in these states are more likely to pay closer attention to the campaigns and become more thoughtful voters. This increased attention and information lead to a more robust democratic process and a better-informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states, as it restores some weight to the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Under the Electoral College system, a large state like Florida, with a close popular vote, receives more attention from presidential candidates than a smaller state like Wyoming. This ensures that presidential candidates have an incentive to address the concerns and needs of voters in both big and small states, promoting a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This system provides a clear winner and avoids the potential complications and costs associated with run-off elections. As demonstrated by past elections, such as Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College produces a decisive outcome even when a candidate has only a plurality of the popular votes. This stability in our electoral process is essential for avoiding unnecessary delays and uncertainties.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical component of our democratic system that ensures certainty of outcome, representative governance, informed voters, equitable representation of states, and simplicity in the electoral process. While it is not a perfect system, it has proven effective and should be preserved. I urge you to consider these arguments and advocate for the continued use of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

1687,0,"In recent years, there has been a growing movement around the world to limit car usage in suburban areas. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from the reliance on automobiles in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve overall quality of life. Several examples from different countries highlight the advantages of limiting car usage in suburban areas.

One such example is the community of Vauban in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden in Vauban, making the streets completely car-free except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. The residents of Vauban have reported feeling happier and less tense without the constant reliance on cars.

Similarly, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced after days of intense smog. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion in the city. The ban aimed to reduce air pollution and promote alternative transportation. Despite the inconveniences, many people supported the ban as a way to lower air pollution and stress levels.

Bogota, Colombia, has also implemented a car-free day as part of an improvement campaign. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during the car-free day, leaving the streets eerily empty of traffic jams. The event aims to promote alternative transportation options and reduce smog. Other Colombian cities have joined the initiative, and municipal authorities from other countries have expressed interest in implementing similar programs.

The trend towards limiting car usage in suburban areas is not limited to Europe and South America. In the United States, there has been a decrease in car ownership and driving, even before the economic downturn. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses each year. This shift in behavior could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a major source of emissions in the US.

The advantages of limiting car usage in suburban areas are numerous. By reducing reliance on cars, communities can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. Car-free neighborhoods also promote healthier and more active lifestyles, as residents are more likely to walk or use bicycles for transportation. Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to less congestion and traffic, making streets safer and improving overall quality of life for residents.

Overall, limiting car usage in suburban areas is a step towards a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.

1409,0,"In the labyrinth of our urban existence, the conversation surrounding the limitations of car usage has become increasingly pertinent, touching upon a spectrum of issues from environmental sustainability to public health and urban planning. Delving into diverse sources illuminates a nuanced tapestry of advantages associated with diminishing our reliance on cars. By embracing alternative transportation methods, we stand to fortify our commitment to a greener planet, enhance public health, and reimagine urban spaces for the better.

Foremost among the benefits of curbing car usage is the positive reverberation it can have on our environment. The International Energy Agency's comprehensive analysis underscores the pivotal role of the transportation sector in global carbon emissions, with automobiles being a substantial contributor. Shifting towards sustainable transportation alternatives, as recommended by the report, emerges as a pivotal strategy for mitigating climate change. A conscientious move away from individual vehicular transport, in favor of communal modes or eco-friendly options like cycling, offers a tangible path to reducing our carbon footprint and fostering a more sustainable future.

Beyond the ecological domain, the implications of limiting car usage extend palpably to public health. The World Health Organization's research underscores the severe health risks associated with vehicular emissions, linking them to respiratory diseases and other health maladies. Beyond merely a matter of environmental concern, the argument for limiting car usage becomes an imperative for safeguarding public health. Evidence suggests that transitioning to cleaner modes of transportation could significantly alleviate the burden on healthcare systems by reducing the incidence of respiratory ailments, thereby fostering a healthier populace.

Moreover, the advantages of minimizing car usage extend into the realm of urban planning, a facet often overlooked in discussions on transportation. Research from the Urban Land Institute emphasizes the need for a paradigm shift towards sustainable urban development, one that prioritizes pedestrians and alternative transportation modes. By investing in robust public transit infrastructure and designing urban spaces that champion pedestrian-friendliness, cities can redefine their landscapes, mitigating traffic congestion and creating environments conducive to community well-being.

While concerns about inconveniences and economic impact may surface, a panoramic view of the evidence underscores the enduring benefits of limiting car usage. It becomes increasingly evident that relinquishing our reliance on cars is not merely a sacrifice but a strategic move towards a multi-faceted solution that addresses environmental, health, and urban planning concerns. As informed citizens, it is incumbent upon us to navigate towards a more sustainable future, where the advantages of limited car usage resonate not just for ourselves but for the generations that will inherit our urban tapestry.",1,"in the labyrinth of our urban existence the conversation surround the limitation of car usage have become increasingly pertinent touch upon a spectrum of issue from environmental sustainability to public health and urban planning delve into diverse source illuminate a nuanced tapestry of advantage associate with diminish our reliance on car by embrace alternative transportation method we stand to fortify our commitment to a greener planet enhance public health and reimagine urban space for the well

158,0,"Limiting the use of cars seems like a crazy idea but if you really think about the importance of cars now a days does not seem like a big deal. People are starting to realize that cars are not the only way of transportation. According to the article, the number of people driving tend to decrease every yearSource 4 S4 paragraph 41 P41 . On the other hand driving can be more beneficial than walking or riding a bike at times. The purpose of the essay is to explain the advantages of limiting car usage.

For all you nature lovers, limiting cars would seem like a good idea. If more people walk or ride bike's, the percent of air pollution would lowerS1 P5. In the United States, it is proven that up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas is caused by carsS1 P5. Cars can be very dangerous if they are driven by the wrong people. Driving under the influence can cause many accidents because drivers tend to go to fast or drive really reckless while intoxicated.

Choosing to walk or ride a bike instead of driving can be more beneficial because of the amount of exercise people can get out of it. One con to driving is having to worry about trafficS3 P20. When not driving you do not have to worry about anything slowing you down. There are many advantages to walking instead of driving that many people do not realize. For example, when walking you do not have to deal with bad parking, being fined for bad driving, or even washing your car which can be a hassle at timesS3 P21.

On the hand, there is nothing wrong with driving at times. A car can be more useful than walking when it comes to going long distances. Now a days everybody is always in a rush and based on where you need to go a car can get there at a faster rate. Accidents can still happen while walking or riding a bike just maybe not as frequently. People can even use smart cars if they are so worried about air pollutionS2 P18.

To wrap things and get to the point, driving less cars can be more beneficial. Walking and riding bike's and avoid less traffic and accidents.

1222,0,"In this generation, our planet is getting filthier and filthier by the day. What many people are too late to realize is that we are the main cause of our dirty planet. Cars contribute to air pollution a lot. What's the only solution to this smog filled atmosphere? There are many, but limiting car usage will definitely be beneficial and highly advantageous. Limiting car usage will help reduce air pollution significantly, and will even help humans out too.

We breathe the air in our atmosphere. When you notice that our atmosphere is as dirty as it is, you really don't want to think about what you are putting into your lungs. The amount of air pollution is an extreme amount, and if not controlled soon, we will be in danger. An advantage of limiting car usage would be that the air pollution will be benefitted, and will be getting lower hopefully. As Robert Duffer states Paris of having "" intensifying smog."" That should be very concerning news and should be a clear wake up call. Limiting car usage is definitely something our planet needs to look into. A healthier atmosphere is better than one filled with smog. The decrease of air pollution is just one of the many advantages of limiting car usage.

Limiting car usage is also advantageous by taking away stress. Many people that drive all know what the pains are of being stuck in traffic. What if you don't wake up on time and you skip taking a shower, or skip eating breakfast, and speed as fast as you can to make it to work? It causes severe stress. From that point on in the day, you literally can't concentrate or focus and you just know it is going to be a rough day. Well, limiting car usage would take some stress away. See, super slow traffic , being late to work, skipping the most important meal of the day, it all just builds up into a lot of unneeded and unwanted stress. If people don't have to deal with congested highways, they could enjoy a nice walk to their job, or ride their bicycle. Doing this would instantly take away stress. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" says Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business manSelsky. There are cities that have tried having a day with no cars. It has worked in taking away stress, as you can see. Taking a bike ride or walking instead of driving a car is also beneficial because it's exercise.

Limting car use has its benefits. People should be aware of the growing danger of air pollution, and limitng car usage will help reduce the amount of pollution. Also, it helps in taking away stress and clearing minds. It is not a bad idea to start limiting our car usage, for we will receive the benefits of decreased car usage.",0,"in this generation our planet be get filthy and filthy by the day what many people be too late to realize be that we be the main cause of our dirty planet car contribute to air pollution a lot what be the only solution to this smog fill atmosphere there be many but limit car usage will definitely be beneficial and highly advantageous limit car usage will help reduce air pollution significantly and will even help human out too

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After considering the information from multiple sources, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register and ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept as the method for selecting the President.

Firstly, one of the key reasons for retaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of the Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide victory for the winning candidate, even with a slight plurality. This ensures a clear and decisive outcome for the presidency.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of everyone's President. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College requires a candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning the presidency. This is important because it ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions and avoids a situation where certain regions feel disenfranchised.

Thirdly, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. Plumer highlights in his article that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to appeal to voters in toss-up states. These voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful decisions, thereby ensuring that the most engaged and informed voters play a significant role in deciding the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the weight of large and small states. Judge Posner argues that the Electoral College restores some of the political balance lost by large states due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This means that presidential candidates are more likely to pay attention to large states during their campaigns, as the number of electoral votes a large state offers is significant. This ensures that issues and concerns of states with larger populations are not overshadowed by smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College produces a clear winner, even if no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This eliminates the need for complicated run-off elections that can prolong the election process and further divide the nation.

While it can be argued that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters who feel their votes will have no effect, the fact remains that the Electoral College method continues to encourage voter participation. As Plumer mentions, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, indicating that people vote to express their political preference rather than expecting their single vote to decide the election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be maintained as the method for electing the President of the United States. The certainty of outcome, the representation of all regions, the focus on swing states, the balance between large and small states, and the avoidance of run-off elections are all valid reasons to support the Electoral College system. While some argue for direct popular vote, the Electoral College effectively achieves the goals of fairness, representation, and avoiding potential election crises.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College in the best interest of our democracy.

 in conclusion the Electoral College should be maintain as the method for elect the President of the United States the certainty of outcome the representation of all region the focus on swing state the balance between large and small state and the avoidance of run off election be all valid reason to support the Electoral College system while some argue for direct popular vote the Electoral College effectively achieve the goal of fairness representation and avoid potential election crisis 

 thank you for consider my perspective on this important matter I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College in the good interest of our democracy

A major advantage of the limitation is to help the people. Many of the people like not having cars available. In In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , a family says "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.Rosenthal"" Not having a car takes pressure off of the people, because they don't have to worry about filling up on gas. They also like it ,because it encourages more exercise. instead of driving to the store or the park you can walk or take a bicycle. In the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, some of the statistics show that ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the cityuneven, pitter sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut off traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"". This is an example of how progressive this change has made on cities. Also mentioned in Selsky article "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". Most of the people say that not having cars takes lot of stress off of them. The positive impact on the people is just one of the many advantages of limited car usage.

another advantage is helping the environment. By limiting car use has really impacted the environment. Rosenthal states that ""experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe.... Passengers cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"". This just shows how much of an impact not using cars has been. In article two Duffer explains why Paris created limitation on car usage. Paris had a huge smog and to help clean it up and to prevent from getting worse, Paris made a law that only certain number license plates could drive on certain days and if you drove on the wrong day than you would be fined. But this helped France get their fuel numbers lower. In Selsky article he talks about how Columnia has a ""car free day"". On this day no cars are allowed with the exception of buses and taxis. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"". Alot of the people like to participate in this event. In Amercia research has been found that ""Amercians are buying fewer cars,driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" Rosenthal.With this information we can be lowering our pollution on our own. Many people did not like the limitations, but learned to like them considering the end result of a healthier environment. These two advantages of limiting car usage is just a couple of the many.",0,"have a limit on car usage have many advantage to it this limitation mainly benefit the people and the environment

1546,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can bring about numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the reliance on cars, communities can improve their quality of life, protect the environment, and promote healthier lifestyles. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage based on information from various sources.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, especially in suburban areas, emissions can be significantly reduced. Vauban, an experimental car-free community in Germany, serves as an example of how limiting car ownership can reduce environmental impact. As stated in Rosenthal's article, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move to this community. The absence of cars in Vauban leads to cleaner air and a healthier environment.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can have positive effects on public health. Andrew Selsky's article describes how millions of Colombians participate in a car-free day each year to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This initiative not only reduces air pollution but also encourages physical activity such as hiking, biking, and skating. By limiting car usage, people are more likely to engage in active forms of transportation, leading to better overall health. Furthermore, limiting car usage can help prevent accidents and reduce traffic congestion, creating safer and less stressful communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient land use and improved accessibility. In Rosenthal's article, it is mentioned that new approaches to suburban planning involve placing stores within walking distance on a main street rather than in malls along distant highways. This concept encourages residents to rely on walking or public transportation, reducing the need for excessive parking spaces and creating more compact and accessible communities. Vauban's car-free streets and emphasis on public transportation also serve as examples of how limiting car usage can lead to smart planning and more efficient use of space.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are manifold. Not only does it help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, but it also promotes healthier lifestyles and more efficient land use. By adopting car-free initiatives and promoting alternative forms of transportation, communities can work towards creating sustainable and livable environments for its residents. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and actively work towards implementing changes that promote a car-free future.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

632,1,"Dear Florida senator, It is in the interest of your state and your nation that you insist the keeping of the Electoral College system of voting. This is overwhelmingly clear because it allows the presidential candidates to focus on the country as a whole in their campaign trail instead of relying on a single region to win the presidency for them, it has been present in this nation since out founding fathers, and the system also shows a clear winner in the end of the election.

In order for the presidential candidate to have a reasonable chance at winning the presidency, he or she has to appeal to the country as a whole instead of just focusing on a particular region. This is all due to the Electoral College. A candidate who is practically assured to win in a region, such as the Northeast, would not campaign as much in those states. The article In Defense of the Electoral College highlights that if that candidate were to become president of the United States, ""The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised...that their votes do not count...that he really isn't their president."" Just think about that. Imagine having a president who got elected just because he won over the South. It would be as if he or she had only that region's interests at heart and did not care for the rest of the nation. The president is suppose to be the leader for the whole nation, not just a section of it. If this were to happen,the nation would be fractured, all because we got rid of the Electoral College. Some might argue that that probably would never happen, and it might not, but we always have to keep in mind the worse scenarios to ensure the best decisions for the United States.

The Electoral College is arguably an old method of voting. It was established by our founding fathers and has been quite realiable over the couple hundred years it has been in service. Admittably, there have been a few blips in the system, but what system doesnt have kinks that need to be rolled out once and a while? It was intended to be ""...a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" as explained in What is the Electoral College?

Why should this system be outed because of a fleeting feeling of anachronism? The intention of this system is meant to give equal votes to both the people and Congress.

The Electoral College system of voting has been under scrutiny lately. It has been a controversial issue. The system has had its share fo faults, but no more than a new system of voting would have. The Electoral College has served its country well and has given voices to the small states, given candidates a broader spectrum on their campaign trail, has been around for over 200 years, and shows a clear winner when all the votes are counted.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to prioritize its continuation in our presidential elections. While some argue in favor of replacing it with a direct popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic system that preserves fairness, regional representation, and the certainty of outcome.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. This is vital to maintaining the stability and integrity of our democratic process. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote while only obtaining 51.3 percent of the popular vote. This demonstrates that the Electoral College prevents close elections from being subject to endless recounts and potential disputes over the popular vote. Furthermore, due to the winner-takes-all allocation of electoral votes, a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory, reducing the likelihood of a tie in the overall electoral vote total.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it ensures that every region of our diverse nation has a say in the selection of the President. By requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College fosters the election of candidates who are truly representative of the entire country. It prevents candidates with only regional popularity from neglecting the interests and concerns of other regions. By having each state's electors vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in that state, the Electoral College ensures a fair representation of regional preferences.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where the outcome is uncertain and every vote matters. In a direct popular vote system, candidates would have no incentive to campaign in states they know they have no chance of winning, which would result in the neglect and disregard of certain states and their issues. This would leave many voters feeling disenfranchised and their interests ignored. By having a system that rewards candidates for engaging with swing states, the Electoral College guarantees that campaigns are conducted across a wide range of states, allowing for a more comprehensive representation of the nation's opinions and concerns.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the influence of large states against small states, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate. In a presidential campaign, large states receive more attention than small states due to their higher number of electoral votes. This ensures that candidates must consider the concerns and perspectives of Americans living in both large and small states. Without the Electoral College, candidates would likely focus exclusively on heavily populated areas, ignoring the needs and interests of rural and less populous areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps prevent the need for run-off elections. By designating a clear winner based on the majority of electoral votes, it avoids potential complications and delays that would arise from run-off elections. This ensures a smooth transition of power and guarantees that the president-elect has a legitimate mandate to govern.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in our democratic system. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes regional representation, encourages candidates to engage with swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is a fair and effective method for electing our president and should be retained to preserve the integrity and stability of our electoral process.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I implore you to keep the Electoral College intact and resist calls for a direct popular vote. I trust that you will make decisions that uphold the principles of our constitution and serve the best interests of our great nation.

Sincerely,

1022,1,"FREEDOM!

We are all americans here so we should have the freedom we were ment to have. I understand that we do in fact have a lot more freedom than other countries but I am talking more on voting freedom. The electoral collegee is, in my opinion and many others, a bad way to decide the president of the United States of America. I believe that for americans we should have a better say in things and agree that we rather have popular voting than what we have now. Others believe the electoral collegee helps with Big States issues. But in the end popular vote is a good way to help people who deserver presidency to get it.

The article The Indefensible Electoral College, many have agreed on abolishing the electoral college. The article The Indefensible Electoral College... states ""...according to a gallop poll in 2000... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to what we are doing now."" If we the people do not get final say into things than we are'nt really as free as we are told we are. If the people want a different voting system it should be granted to us. A good example to people who had been effected by this was Al Gore. The article states. ""Al Gore who had won by popular vote but still lost the presidency to the electoral collegee."" This goes to show that he was someone that many wanted as a president but where cheated out by the electoral collegee.

Others may believe that the electoral collegee helps not let bigger and more populated states get more attention than a smaller state would. But even by popular vote this would be the same. If a populated state votes then they will get basically the same say as they would with the electoral collegee but it would give them more say. Whilst other low population states get less votes and attention just like with the electoral collegee. So even though it would make a great change with other things, this matter is no problem.

Few have lost presidency due to the quirks in the electoral collegee. A good example is Al Gore who I talked about earlier. But still in the future changing to popular vote will help people who earned presidency actually get it. Instead of being scammed out of their votes by the electoral collegee. If someone has earned the presidencty then they should have the right to it, but with the electoral collegee in the way some are unable to actually do this. If we the people want someone to be the president than we want them! Al Gore won popular vote but since we do not get the only say he had lost presidency. If popular demand was the only voting system than we would probably be in a better place right now.

In conclusion, we the people of the united states deserve to actually have our own and only say in to who is going to lead us. If we say we want them, we want them... I understand that we our the ones that get the say, but we are being evened out by state percentage, so basically popular voting is ruled out. Popular voting is a better way to vote mainly because it is straight forward and to the point. If someone receives more individual votes than they should be the president... It is a easy straight forward process...",0,"FREEDOM

597,0,"Can you imagine living in a place where there is no driving? It is an amazing thing to think if every person doesn't drive in one big city that it saves so much pollution going in to the air. Another thing to think about is if everyone in a city didn't drive and walked everywhere, more people would stay healthier by staying in shape. Some people think that owning a car is more stressful than just walking everywhere. If you don't own a car you don't have to pay for insurance, don't have to pay for gas, and don't have to pay for repairs when something goes wrong in a vehicle. To me it sounds like there is a lot of advantages in limiting car use.

One solid reason why not using cars as much is the pollution going in the air. In Paris, France motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at their house or else they would be fined. The next day odd numbered license plates motorists had to leave their vehicles at home. It was a hardship at first to get people to follow these new rules, but after about five days everything started to cool down. The pollution had dropped 60 percent in Paris which is exactly what the city was looking for. Limiting the car usage didn't just save pollution from going in the air, but also there wasn't as much traffic as there usually was. It also made Paris a safer place to be outside and not damage the citizens lungs. The capital city of France also made transportation free MondayFriday to help the cause. Soon enough people that had both license plates could drive on the same day.

In Bogota, Colombia they do a car free day that is becoming popular in that part of the world. It is awesome to think there are 7 million people in that city and none of them are using a car. People that violated this goal on this day were charged a 25 fine. People from other countries came to see how this day worked and they loved it. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" You can just imagine all the benefits of everyone not using a car in a city for a whole day. Restaurants and parks would be visited and used more and everyone would be getting more exercise. All in all this idea was genius.

As you can see limiting car usage can help out the area big time that it is taking place.

1532,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. As shown in the passage set, communities around the world are experimenting with car-free or car-reduced neighborhoods to encourage alternative transportation methods, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve quality of life. These initiatives demonstrate that there are clear benefits to limiting car usage, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, increased physical activity, and enhanced social interactions.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on the environment. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are responsible for climate change. In many car-intensive areas, passenger cars are responsible for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing car usage and promoting alternative transportation options such as walking, cycling, and public transit, communities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion and improve air quality. Suburbs and cities that have implemented car-free or car-reduced zones have seen a significant decrease in traffic and congestion. For example, Vauban in Germany, a car-free community, has only two places for car parking and as a result, 70 percent of families do not own cars. This has led to less crowded streets and a more peaceful and enjoyable living environment for residents. Additionally, by reducing the number of cars on the road, air pollution from vehicle exhaust is also reduced, leading to cleaner and healthier air for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity and healthier lifestyles. When cars are not the primary mode of transportation, people are more likely to walk, bike, or use public transit. These forms of transportation require physical exertion and can contribute to a more active and healthy lifestyle. Regular physical activity has numerous health benefits, including reduced risk of chronic diseases, improved mental well-being, and increased overall fitness levels.

In addition to the health benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to increased social interactions and stronger communities. When people rely less on cars and more on alternative transportation methods, such as walking or cycling, they are more likely to interact with their neighbors and communities. This can lead to a stronger sense of belonging and community engagement.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. Car ownership and maintenance can be expensive, and by reducing car usage, individuals can save money on fuel, car insurance, parking fees, and maintenance costs. This can lead to more disposable income and financial stability for individuals and families.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. As seen in the passage set, communities that have implemented car-free or car-reduced neighborhoods have experienced benefits such as improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, increased physical activity, and enhanced social interactions. By promoting alternative transportation methods and decreasing reliance on cars, individuals and communities can contribute to a more sustainable and enjoyable living environment for all.",1,"advantage of limit car usage 

 limit car usage can have numerous advantage for both individual and the environment as show in the passage set community around the world be experiment with car free or car reduce neighborhood to encourage alternative transportation method reduce greenhouse gas emission and improve quality of life these initiative demonstrate that there be clear benefit to limit car usage include improved air quality reduce traffic congestion increase physical activity and enhance social interaction 

 one of the primary advantage of limit car usage be the positive impact it can have on the environment car be a major contributor to greenhouse gas emission which be responsible for climate change in many car intensive area passenger car be responsible for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emission by reduce car usage and promote alternative transportation option such as walking cycling and public transit community can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and combat climate change 

 furthermore limit car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion and improve air quality suburb and city that have implement car free or car reduce zone have see a significant decrease in traffic and congestion for example Vauban in Germany a car free community have only two place for car parking and as a result 70 percent of family do not own car this have lead to less crowded street and a more peaceful and enjoyable living environment for resident additionally by reduce the number of car on the road air pollution from vehicle exhaust be also reduce lead to clean and healthy air for everyone

1992,0,"Title: The Reflections on Reducing Car Usage

Modern societies have increasingly become car-dependent, exacerbating the environmental issues and other related challenges. However, initiatives across the globe such as car-free suburbs, restriction of car usage, car-free days, and growing cultural shifts have demonstrated the multiple benefits of limiting car usage. These examples may not only combat environmental issues, but also foster healthier lifestyles and stronger communities.

Car-less communities, such as Vauban in Germany, show how life can progress smoothly without cars. Here, most families do not own cars and have achieved a much superior peace of mind, according to one resident (Rosenthal, 2009). Reduced car usage in such communities succeeds in drastically lowering greenhouse gas emissions, a major contributor to global warming and pollution(Rosenthal, 2009). Similar actions to limit car usage can also be seen in larger cities, such as Paris, where temporary driving bans were enforced in response to near-record pollution levels(Duffer, 2014).

Additionally, initiatives such as car-free days in Colombia, not only aligned millions towards the use of alternative commuting modes but also helped reduce smog and promote a healthier lifestyle (Selsky, 2002). These events advocate for the active reconsideration of over-reliance on cars and recognition of the benefits of using other methods of transportation. 

On top of pollution mitigation and health benefits, reducing car-dependency might foster stronger local communities with improved social interactions. In the car-free suburban life like Vauban's, streets are filled with bicycle noise and children's laughter instead of overbearing car noise (Rosenthal, 2009). Besides improving the quality of life, these communities have also been found to improve local economies by promoting local stores over distant shopping malls (Rosenthal, 2009).

Furthermore, emerging cultural shifts suggest an ongoing decline in car ownership and usage, which may have substantial benefits for the environment, as transportation is the second largest source of America’s carbon emissions(Rosenthal, 2013). The rise in telecommuting, shared commuting, bike sharing schemes, and vehicle sharing programs reflect these changing priorities (Rosenthal, 2013). 

However, the transition away from cars should not disregard the importance of personal vehicles in some circumstances and locations. Therefore, while reducing car usage, it is necessary to ensure accessible and efficient public transportation systems are in place to address the mobility needs of all citizens.

In conclusion, the reduction of car usage can contribute to combating global environmental issues, improving community health, inducing social cohesion, and encouraging economic prosperity. This change presents opportunities not only for a sustainable future but also for innovative approaches to fulfill our transportation needs.",1,"title the reflection on reduce car usage

436,0,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in a world with not a lot of car usage? Imagine never driving but walking or ridding a bike to any place you would want to go to. The mall, grocery store, movies all a small walking distance away. That would be great right? You'd be helping yourself and the world by making you fit and the world's pollution decrees. That sound interesting I feel like the world is slowly coming to a stopping point with car use.

A world with cleaner air is what we would have if everyone limited the use of their cars. According to "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal "" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the united states."" The United States produces a greater amount of greenhouse gasses. If we limited the use of our cars the United States would have better air making the United States a better place to live. The United States has a very large number of people already pulling away from using cars. According to "" The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal."" Americans are buying fewer cars,driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Cars are not needed for everyday use because people seem to get around greatly.

Limiting the use of you care can greatly help everyone. The United States has a very large amount of unhealthy people. People who don't get to walk or do fitness regularly to be able to stay healthy and fit. Having limited the use of your car it would as help you mentally. In the article ""In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal Heidrun Walter a mother of two says "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" If a mother of two says that not using her car makes her happier. In the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" by Andrew selsky a businessman said "" It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution."" So if you ask me the would would be better without using cars everyday it's a win win situation.

People all around the world are taking part in limiting the use of cars. People from Colombia to Pairs to Germany. People all over the word are all trying to help out the world by limiting the use of cars. In the article "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky the author talks about how everyone took a ""car free"" This was Bogota's third straight year of no car day the only cars that were allowed to be on the road were those of busies or taxis. The violators that drove their car are faced with a fine of 25. In the text of ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. She says that the worlds car culture is slowly coming to a end fewer people are getting their licenses and more are organizing their social lives and summer jobs around where they could was or take a buss to.

The world is on a better path with people trying to limit the use of their cars. The world gets better and so do you. In the articel ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" by Andrew Selsky says that the business in the small town have also boomed "" Parks and sports centers also have boomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restraints and up scale shopping districts have cropped up.""

2152,1,"Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to discuss the current method the United States uses to elect the president: the Electoral College. Some citizens, including me, have expressed concerns about this system, and there seems to be an increasing sentiment in favor of shifting to a popular vote method. Through this letter, I wish to voice my reasons for supporting this shift, while also giving due weight to counterarguments.

The Electoral College, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register, is an indirect voting system where citizens vote for electors, who then elect the President (Text 1, Paragraph 2). However, as Bradford Plumer argues in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College"", this method can lead to results that do not align with the popular vote, causing a president to be elected with minority support (Text 9). Plumer moreover points out the ""disaster factor,"" wherein potential issues with electors, or an electoral tie, could significantly disrupt the election process (Text 11, Text 12).

On the opposing side, Judge Richard A. Posner provides several practical reasons in defense of the Electoral College. He mentions its function in ensuring a candidate's appeal beyond specific regions, focusing attention on the most thoughtful and deciding voters, balancing the political weight of large states, and avoiding possibilities of run-off elections (Text 15-22). While these are valid points, I contend they do not outweigh the fundamental principle of democracy that each citizen's vote should hold equal influence.

It is unfair, as Plumer suggests, that due to the winner-take-all system, residents in certain states are seldom prioritized by the candidates, who instead focus on ' swing' states (Text 13). This reality disengages many potential voters who feel their votes will not count. The Electoral College does not incentivize the candidates to broaden their appeal to voters in “safe” states.

Furthermore, the current system's opacity often confuses voters, leading to accidental voting for the wrong candidate (Text 10). In contrast, a direct popular vote method is comparatively more transparent and empowering for the citizens, promoting a more inclusive democratic process.

I acknowledge that removing the Electoral College, fixed in the Constitution, entails a significant and complex alteration in our nation's structure, and therefore should not be hastily enacted without thorough examination and debate. However, I implore you to consider promoting discussions on this potential transition towards direct popular vote to ensure that every citizen's voice is equally valued in our democracy.

I look forward to your thoughtful consideration on this matter.

2170,1,"Dear Senator,

I write to you as a concerned citizen of our great state regarding the current system we use to elect the President of the United States - the Electoral College. The Electoral College, as described by the Office of the Federal Register, is a process that was established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. However, much has been debated about the effectiveness of this system, and whether a shift to direct popular voting should be observed.

The critics of this system argue that the Electoral College is fundamentally undemocratic. As Bradford Plumer opines, the winning candidate may not necessarily reflect the will of the majority voters, as was the case in 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency due to the electoral vote. They argue that because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates focus their campaigns only on the competitive states, neglecting the others. This may leave many potential voters feeling alienated and neglected. The electoral system also allows for the possibility, albeit slim, of a tie in the electoral vote, which could lead the decision of the president to the House of Representatives. Arguments such as these against the Electoral College system highlight its tendency to marginalize the principle of majority rule.

Though these criticisms are valid, there are indeed compelling arguments in the defense of the Electoral College system as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner. He points out, among others, that this system provides certainty of outcome, given its winner-take-all mechanism, and the fact that the ""winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"".  Moreover, the system requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal, thereby preventing the possibility of a president with only regional support. Perhaps most importantly, the Electoral College avoids the complication of run-off elections, as it invariably produces a clear winner. 

To address the concerns of critics, we can suggest necessary reforms to the system rather than a complete abolition. For example, we can consider dividing the electoral votes proportionally as done in Maine and Nebraska, rather than winner-takes-all, in each state. 

We must remember that the founding fathers instituted the Electoral College as a safeguard mechanism to balance the effect of populous and sparsely populated states and it remains a relevant mechanism today. As your constituent, I recognize the complexity of this issue and urge you, Senator, to carefully weigh the implications of such a significant change in our electoral process before taking action.

376,1,"There are many things that could go wrong with the way we the United states are voting now which is why we should use election by popular vote. There are many reasons why we should switch to popular vote but there are three that are most important. The candidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though he won the popular vote, it would be less likely to get a tie, and the candidate would have to campaign in every state because there wouldn't be a winnertakesall situation.

Most importantly the candidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though they received the popular vote. The representative electors have the final say in who is elected because they are the ones that put in the votes. An example of this is Al Gore back in 2000. According to some polls Al Gore lost the election thanks to the electoral college because he won the popular vote but still lost the election. Al Gore had recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush but still lost. george W. Bush had 271 electoral votes to Al Gore's 266. However, this is not the last time this will happen and voters can expect to see it happen again in the future were the popular vote winner loses the presidency.

Not only can they win the popular vote but still lose the presidency, they also risk the event of a tie were the vote would then go to the House of Representatives. In the event of a tie meaning that each candidate got an equal number of votes from the electors the House of Representatives would have the opportunity to vote for the president. This is not a fair system in any way because that would mean the representative for Wyoming who is only representing 500,000 thousand people would have as much say as a representative from California who is there representing 35 million voters! There has been many close incidents of a tie so it is possible for this to happen. In 1968 a shift of 41,971 votes would have put the election in a tie. In 1976, id 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii would have voted the other way then the race for presidency would have gone into the hands of the House.

Furthermore the candidates would have to campaign in every state because there wouldn't be winnertakesall which means the winner of the electoral votes gets all the votes within that state even if some of the residents did not vote for that party. The candidates would have to campaign in every state rather than just the ""swing"" states which are people that have not yet decided which way they wanted to vote. the cenidates dont campaign in a state if they know that they have no chance of winning the electoral votes in that state. During the 2000 election a remarkable seventeen states did not see the campaign one time nor did the people in the 25 largest media markets see a campaign ad whether it be on t. v., in the newspaper, or over the radio. If the president was elected by popular vote than every state would be considered a swing state.

In conclusion the President of the United States should be elected by popular vote because a candidate would not have to worry about winning the popular vote but losing the election, the possibility of a tie would decrease, and the candidate would havw to campaign in every state. These are just a few of the many reasons that we should switch over to a popular vote system, plus who wouldnt wan't to have a little more say in who runs our magnificent country.",0,"there be many thing that could go wrong with the way we the United state be vote now which be why we should use election by popular vote there be many reason why we should switch to popular vote but there be three that be most important the candidate would n't have to worry about lose even though he win the popular vote it would be less likely to get a tie and the candidate would have to campaign in every state because there would n't be a winnertakesall situation

798,1,"The Electoral College is a process that has been used for presidential elections since the Founding Fathers established it in the constitution. This system does not necessary give the voters a direct vote, but rather a vote for a slate of electors that vote for them. The voters entrust that their elected slate will vote for their favored presidential candidate. It brings up the argument whether this system of voting should be changed or kept. The Electoral College has some of its good points, but over all, it needs to be changed. Voters need a direct say in their vote, and this system turns off the interest of potential voters.

The voters of the United states should have the ability to directly vote for who they want as President. After all, the people are what make up the country and should have say. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" says Bradford Plumer in The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.

This means that the Electoral College is unfair to the people because the slate they vote for might not even vote for their candidate. Also, in the same article, Plumer states, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This means that there is a chance that the electors could vote for whoever they please.

This system of voting does not give the voters a direct say as to who they want, but also turns off the interest of voters who should be voting for their country. ""Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know that have no chance of winning..."" as said by Plumer. People within those states would have no motivation to vote for their president because their potienial president did not come to their state to convince them to vote. The candidates are only focused on getting majority of the electoral votes, and not who the people really want. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets ddin't get to see a single campaign ad,"" Plumer had stated. These states lack any information about the potential ruler of their country just because the candidates are focused on the states that will help them win.

Although ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for a party's nominee,"" as said by Richard A. Posner in In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , the possibility of having a winner based on electoral vote and not popular vote is very much possible. For instance, the 2000 election, Gore had won popular vote but due to the electoral vote, Bush had won the election. Gore won the vote for the most popular all over the nation, but because the electoral college had a majority of Bush, it was like the nation's actual vote did not matter.

The Electoral College is unfair to the people because they do not get a direct say for who they want, and the candidates only focus on states that will help them win based on electoral vote. The people need a say exactly who they want and should not depend on others to do the vote for them. Canidates should not only appeal to states that would make them win, but also to other states so the whole nation knows exactly who might be ruling over their country.",0,"the Electoral College be a process that have be use for presidential election since the Founding Fathers establish it in the constitution this system do not necessary give the voter a direct vote but rather a vote for a slate of elector that vote for they the voter entrust that their elect slate will vote for their favor presidential candidate it bring up the argument whether this system of voting should be change or keep the Electoral College have some of its good point but over all it need to be change voter need a direct say in their vote and this system turn off the interest of potential voter

 this system of voting do not give the voter a direct say as to who they want but also turn off the interest of voter who should be vote for their country because of the winnertakesall system in each state candidate do n't spend time in state they know that have no chance of win as say by Plumer People within those state would have no motivation to vote for their president because their potienial president do not come to their state to convince they to vote the candidate be only focus on get majority of the electoral vote and not who the people really want during the 2000 campaign seventeen state did n't see the candidate at all include Rhode Island and South Carolina and voter in 25 of the large medium market ddin't get to see a single campaign ad Plumer have state these state lack any information about the potential ruler of their country just because the candidate be focus on the state that will help they win 

 although each party select a slate of elector trust to vote for a party 's nominee as say by Richard A. Posner in in Defense of the Electoral College five reason to keep our despised method of choose the President the possibility of have a winner base on electoral vote and not popular vote be very much possible for instance the 2000 election Gore have win popular vote but due to the electoral vote Bush have win the election Gore win the vote for the most popular all over the nation but because the electoral college have a majority of Bush it be like the nation 's actual vote do not matter 

 the Electoral College be unfair to the people because they do not get a direct say for who they want and the candidate only focus on state that will help they win base on electoral vote the people need a say exactly who they want and should not depend on other to do the vote for they canidate should not only appeal to state that would make they win but also to other state so the whole nation know exactly who might be rule over their country"
368,0,"Limiting car usage can affect our environment in so many ways. Although you may have not ever thought about it before, limiting car usage can help not only our environment, but ourselves as well. Let's talk about what can happen if we ditch our vehicles.

People in Germany have completely given up their cars for the most part already. Since most of their residents are suburban pioneers, they find almost no point of even owning a car. Here in America we use cars for transportation for almost everything! In Germany, many have admitted that owning a car makes them stressd. Heidrun Walter who is a media trainer said, ""I'm much happier this way."" The trend of not owning a car isn't just growing in Europe. Lot's of families from Chicago are abandoning their cars as well.

The city of Paris has banned driving for a good environmental reason. There has been so much pollution in the city from smog that there was a driving ban to clear the city's air. If anyone is caught driving, they are sent a fine of 22euro, which is 31 here in the US. Although this may seem like a harsh punishment, it has helped Paris overcome a lot of its smog. The only exceptions when it comes to driving are delivery companies and public transit.

Bogota, Columbia has jumped on the bandwagon along with many other places. This country put a ban on cars to prevent smog as well. There was a huge turnout on their part for doing this. businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Ever since the day where they banned cars for a short period of time, there has been many other new advancements in their society. Parks and sports centers have spread throughout the city, uneven sidewalks have been replaced, rushhour restrictions have drastically cut traffic, and new restaurantsupscale shopping districts have opened up.

Last, limiting car usage also has a great effect when it comes to getting rid of greenhouse gas emissions. Research has suggested that Americans are now buying fewer cars, fewer licenses, and overall driving less. It seems as many people are starting to open up their eyes and realize all of the long term effects that come with car overusage. Article 4 clearly states that many sociologist believe that if this pattern persist, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. It is said that creating cities in which pedestrian, bicyle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to not only save time and conserve resources, but also lower emissions and improve our safety.

All in all, there are many advantages when it comes to limiting car usage. We can help dramatically improve our environment and safety. More people should take into consideration about being more conservative when it comes to transportation. We can work around a lot of it by simply walking or riding our bikes short distances rather than wasting a lot of energy with cars.",0,"limit car usage can affect our environment in so many way although you may have not ever think about it before limit car usage can help not only our environment but ourselves as well let we talk about what can happen if we ditch our vehicle

979,0,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage helps to cleanse the environment, saves citizens money, and can help with improving citizens health.

One advantage to limiting car usage is that it will cleanse the environment. Cars give off a number of gallons of gas each time they're used. These toxic chemicals found in gases pollute the air. Imagine breathing in all of that waste! Studies have actually found evidence that the toxins from car fuel are very harmful to the health of animals, plants, and humans. It can cause breathing difficulties associated with problems in the lungs when inhaled too heavily as well as it dirties plants and makes it more difficult for them to grow healthy, like they should, and it can even poison and kill the animals. Who wants to take a risk so deadly?

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it will save citizens money. Cars aren't cheap. Depending on the make and model of the car, they can cost anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000. Insurance and keeping up with the maintenance of a car also costs a lot. Car owners should be expecting to pay 100500 a month for car maintence, and if insurance is required, depending on the state that the car owner lives in, than another additional 100. Finally, is the price for gas. The price for gas in this day in age economy ranges from 3.006.00 per gallon! If a car owner has a long way to drive, but doesn't have a lot of money, heshe may want to consider taking a bus or carpooling with someone to help them out.

A rather more humorous advantage to limiting car usage, is that it could help give citizens a work out. Instead of driving where they need to go, people could walk to their desired destination and burn a ton of calories while doing it! Or in contrast to waiting for a friend to pick them up outside their houses, they could walk to a bus stop and wait for the bus to take them wherever they need to go. This also relates to saving money and helping cleanse the environment. Citizens' will pay less for a gym membership now that they're getting a work out. They'll also be helping the environment by not burning all of those fuel wastes just to get to where they need to go. It's a winwin for everyone!

Of course, there are many advantages to limiting car usage for our citizens, their wallets, and the environment. These three are just a few of the plentiful, conservative ways out there however, they're all extroardinarily efficient.",0,"there be many advantage to limit car usage limit car usage help to cleanse the environment save citizen money and can help with improve citizen health

Subject: The Electoral College: A System of Balance and Representation

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is an essential part of our democratic process that ensures representation and protects the interests of all states.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This system consists of the selection of electors, their meeting and voting for the President and Vice President, followed by the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. It is a carefully designed process that ensures a fair and balanced election.

One of the advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. While disputes over the final result can occur, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents lengthy debates and recounts that could potentially destabilize the nation. In addition, the winner-take-all system ensures a clear, decisive victory and minimizes the possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election of the President. Candidates must have trans-regional appeal and consider the interests of all states, rather than focusing solely on densely populated areas. This prevents the dominance of a few states over the entire election process, ensuring a more balanced representation.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This leads to increased campaign efforts and attention from the candidates, allowing voters in these states to make more informed decisions. Centralizing the election process through a popular vote would result in candidates concentrating their efforts on densely populated urban areas, ignoring the needs and concerns of the majority of the country.

Moreover, the Electoral College gives due weight to large states, addressing the malapportionment of the Senate described in the Constitution. The winner-take-all system means that candidates pay more attention to large states, as winning by a slight margin in a large state can secure a significant number of electoral votes. This ensures that the interests and concerns of these states are taken into account during the campaign and presidency.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This system produces a clear winner and avoids the complications and uncertainties that would arise from run-off elections. It maintains the stability and efficiency of our election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College can discourage potential voters who live in states with political leanings opposite to their own, the voter turnout in presidential elections speaks for itself. Nearly half of the eligible American population participated in the 2012 election, indicating that people vote to express their political preferences, not with the belief that their vote alone will change the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College ensures fairness, balance, and representation in the election of the President of the United States. It prevents any single state or region from dominating the election process and ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns and interests of all states. I urge you to support the preservation of the Electoral College, a system that has proved its effectiveness for over two centuries.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages of the Electoral College and make a decision that upholds the principles of our democratic system.

Sincerely,

1725,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
The growing trend of limiting car usage in various parts of the world is gaining attention due to its positive impact on the environment and quality of life. By adopting smart planning and promoting alternative transportation methods, communities are revolutionizing the way they function. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage, focusing on reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and enhanced access to public transportation and community spaces.

Paragraph 1: Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Car ownership and usage contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, which is a major concern in tackling climate change. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. Limiting car usage in suburban areas, such as Vauban, Germany, can help to mitigate these emissions. Vauban's innovative approach, which restricts car ownership and emphasizes public transportation, serves as an example for other communities to follow.

Paragraph 2: Improved Air Quality
In densely populated cities like Paris, where car pollution reaches dangerous levels, limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality. Robert Duffer's article on Paris' partial driving ban highlights how restricting car access led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a decline in smog levels. By implementing measures such as license plate-based driving bans and promoting alternative transportation options, cities can create cleaner and healthier environments for their citizens.

Paragraph 3: Enhanced Access to Public Transportation and Community Spaces
Limiting car usage also leads to greater accessibility to public transportation and community spaces. Elisabeth Rosenthal's article highlights how Vauban, Germany places stores within walking distance instead of distant malls. By adopting this approach, communities can encourage residents to use public transportation and engage in healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation, like walking or cycling. Additionally, as seen in Bogota, Colombia, car-free days provide an opportunity for people to explore alternative transportation methods, while promoting a sense of community and reducing traffic congestion. Andrew Selsky's article notes that these car-free days have become a significant event, inspiring millions to embrace alternative transportation options.

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage offers several advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and enhanced access to public transportation and community spaces. Communities worldwide are recognizing the importance of transitioning from car-centric planning to more sustainable and people-friendly approaches. By adopting these measures, we can create healthier and more sustainable cities that prioritize the well-being of both the environment and citizens.",1,"title the advantage of limit car usage

670,1,"Is the Electoral College a good thing? A Majority would say no and that it is a non democratic method of selecting a president. Many believe this system should be changed, as it is not really an accurate way to show what the majority wants, and that the president of the united states should be chosen through the popular vote. What if there is a tie in the electoral vote? In the case of a tie the election would be given to the house of representatives. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, this isn't really and accurate reflection of the will of the people.

The electoral college is a system that has voters vote for a slate of electors, not the president. If you lived in california, for example, and voted democrat, you actually voted for a slate of Democratic electors pledged to the Democratic party. These electors, if they won the statewide election, would then go to congress and the Democrat candidate would recieve the vote of these electors. Anyone not holding public office can be an elector. And it depends on the state on how they are picked. Sometimes the presidential candidates themselves choose who the electors are. Voters can't always control who the electors end up voting for.

Of course the electoral college method has its upsides. Being that with this system in place the outcome of the election is more certain. Of Course a dispute over the outcome is possible, it did happen in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. However, it can be argued that this method can turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, Democrats in Texas for example, or Republicans in California. These voters, knowing their vote will have little to no effect, would have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would if the president was chosen through the popular vote.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Most states have a winnertakeall system in place. Which means that they award the winning presidential candidate all of the electors votes. Because of this candidates dont spend time in states they have no chance of winning. They choose to mainly focus on the undecided states. In some cases, states don't get to see the candidates at all during the campaign, or even a single campaign ad.

In short, Does the electoral college work? In some ways yes but in many ways no. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The electoral college should be abolished, and the decision of who becomes president should be left to the popular vote seeing as it is a more accurate representation of the collective will of the people.",0,"be the Electoral College a good thing a Majority would say no and that it be a non democratic method of select a president many believe this system should be change as it be not really an accurate way to show what the majority want and that the president of the united states should be choose through the popular vote what if there be a tie in the electoral vote in the case of a tie the election would be give to the house of representative give that many voter vote one party for president and another for congress this be n't really and accurate reflection of the will of the people

715,0,"Nowadays does everyone rely on cars frequently, and as of late has this practise begun to show its numerous negative effects, of which shall be discussed. The articles presented by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robbert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky portray the effects of such frequent use of cars and effort many areas are already making to limit car usage the articles also explore the many benefits of limiting car usage such as reduction of pollution.

Some large and global cities, such as Paris, are known for the substantial amount of pollution present in their air. According to Source 2: ""Paris bans drivin due to smog"", Paris already has more smog than other European capitals in general with one hundred fortyseven micrograms of particulate matter per one cubic metre. In comparison to brussels one hundred fourteen micrograms and London's seventynine and seven tenths, Paris' pollution is clearly more concentrated. According to Source 4: ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the United States features broad expanses and many suburbs, being one of the places in the world where cars are greatly centred upon by the people. Thus can one imagine the exceptionally negative impact that cars most likely have on the air quality of the urban and suburban areas throughout the United States. Elizabeth Rosenthal's Source 1: ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" states that the widespread use of automobiles worldwide are one of the greatest obstacles to overcome in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles. Twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are from cars and even up to fifty percent are from cars in the United States. This furthermore leads on to the many benefits that limits on car usage have to offer and the efforts certain areas are making to create these benefits.

Source 1 provides some useful insight efforts on the possibilities and advantages of limiting car use over continuing the mainstream automobile trend. Vauban is a community in Germany near France and Switzerland, on the outskirts of Freiburg. Here is where parking areas in streets, driveways, and home garages are infrequent to find or are outright forbidden. Only two places are available for parking, which are the large garages at the edge of the community, with parking spaces going out for forty thousand dollars. In Vauban, only thirty percent of the population own cars, and fiftyseven percent of people sold their cars in order to move here. Apparently, the lack of automobiles seems to have a calming effect as is professed by Heidrun Walter, who is quoted from Source 1: ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Source 2 show how Paris had to create a driving ban temporarily due to smog. Car traffic was lowered to sixty percent in Paris after a week of the smog and the ban helped to clear this outbreak so commuting could resume to its regular ways without impediment from the heavy pollution. Andrew Selsky's Source 3: ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", Bogota of Colombia had a day imposed where cars were banned and only buses and taxis were permitted. This was imposed to support alternative transportation as well as to reduce the amount of smog in the city, similar to the ban Paris has imposed. Although there was rain that same day, it did not stop people from participating, and similar to Heidrun Walter's comment in Source 1, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The campaign for these Days Without Cars began in the mid1990s and has resulted in construction of one hundred eighteen bicycle paths and major public work repairs of sidewalks and blooming of parks and sports centers. Restrictions imposed during rushhour have reduced traffic greatly in a positive way and new shopping districts and restaurants are appearing constantly. Even in the great urban automobile centres of America, vehicle use seems to be reducing, as presented in Source 4. Acording to an analysis by Doug Short, a member of an investment research company called Advisor Perspectives, miles driven in the United States has slowly fallen since 2005 it is apparent that if the pattern continues, carbon emissions and the environment will be positively impacted to a substantial extent. Even Bill Ford, CEO of the Ford Motor Company, has porposed a business plan for a world in which ownership of a vehicle is undesirable, a place where walking, biking, low use of private cars, and public transportation is woven together to conserve resources, decrease emissions, and increase the level of urban safety.

As shown, such a level of car limitation would be highly beneficial to everyone as a whole. There would be less pollution, driving would be safer, and the urban economy would spring as more people walk or bike to transport themselves. Bill Ford's idea of a world where owning a car is impractical would be highly viable, and the city of Vauban has already begun the move.

1208,0,"In many places around the world people own cars and drive around almost every day. But what many people dont know is that cars can release harmful gases that can hurt the earth's environments. Three reasons why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it prevents traffic, it helps the environment and your community, and we dont really need cars to live our everyday lives.

Limiting car usage in your community is good because it prevents traffic. Everyday, people use their cars to go places even if the place their going to is down the street and that causes traffic some times. For example, in Paris there has been days of nearrecord pollution due to traffic so Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from pollution. They said every Monday motorist with evennumbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or face a 22 euro fine. This ban helped because congestion dropped 60 percent in the capital of France just after five days of the ban was set.

Another reason why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it helps prevent pollution to the air around you. Cars can release gasses that can harm the earths environment and the community around you. Which is why in the United States the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities much like the one in Vauban, Germany. These ""car Free"" communities consist of a small town where the usage of cars is illegal, you are not even allowed to own homes with a garage in it. This is very good for the environment and can prevent air pollution.

We should limit how often we use cars because we dont really need them to get around and many countries believe so too. For example in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that was set to spread out to other countries, during this program millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. One reason why these people might have done this is because any one who violated this rule would have been fined 25 but the main goal for this was to prevent smog in their countries environment. The turn out however was huge! Even when there was rain it didn't stop them. The mayor of Bogota said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" and now for the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event.

There are many reasons why we should limit the usage of cars in our communities because it prevents traffic , helps the environment and because we dont really need to use cars so often , take Colombia for example. So lets take action and follow the steps that many countires and communities are taking to help our communities.",0,"in many place around the world people own car and drive around almost every day but what many people do nt know be that car can release harmful gas that can hurt the earth 's environment three reason why limit car usage in your community be good be because it prevent traffic it help the environment and your community and we do nt really need car to live our everyday life

1206,0,"Wouldnt it be great to hear that Just by citizens limiting car usage they are kind of making the world a better place? Instead of driving from place to place, they at the park, or taking a nice walk around town, or maybe even having a little fun ice skating. Its exciting to hear by just walking anywhere instead of taking a car or a motor vehicle, you are making the environment better. Also who doesn't love less traffic in the streets? Limiting car usage has so many advantages, you maybe just have to get out of your car to see it. Imagine walking down the street and hearing the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional sound of a distant motor.

In Vauban Germany, most streets are completely car free. Heidrun Walter said ""when i had a car i was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and fifty percent in some car intensive areas in the Untied States. pollution is a huge problem, not only for us but for the environment. Just by limiting cars,you can reduce gas emissions. In the the passage it says that in the untied states, the environmental protection agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost four thousand drivers were fined, and they also had their cars impounded due to some of their reactions to the fine. large traffic went down in the capital of france after five days of intensifying smog. In the passage it says that cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. They blamed diesel fuel because france has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. All these car fumes and bad pollution can cause many dangers and car usage has a big part in this problem. By limiting car usage, the smog in paris cleared enough on monday for the ruling french party to rescined the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday.

In another place, Bogota Colombia, it was the third straight year cars have been banned with only busses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of seven million. They did this so they can reduce smog. The people who didnt follow the rules while this day was in progress, they faced twenty five dollor fines. this day can do good for many people and can give you many opportunitys that you havent got to do before. In the passage a businessman named carlos arturo plaza said ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" he said that while riding a two seat bicycle with his wife. the usage of cars is not always need, having a little fun wont hurt, taking a walk, going to the park is always a good thing. Even if it rains, that wont stop the people from participating in this day.

Car usage isnt the worst thing in the world but there are many advantages when you dont use them. pollution decreases, as well as smog. you have a day to enjoy the outside world. while you do that think of the gas emmisons you arent putting in the environment. People dont really notice it but pollution has a big effect to global warming.

2080,1,"Dear Senator [Your Senator's Last Name],

I write to you today to express my thoughts on a pressing issue: the method by which we elect our President. Specifically, I implore you to rally support for maintaining the often-debated Electoral College system.

Our country's founding fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between Congressional election of the President and direct popular vote (Federal Register). They carefully considered the balance between majority rule and protection against mob rule, creating a system to enable broader representation across our diverse nation. Indeed, keeping the Electoral College ensures that between our densely-populated urban areas and sparsely populated rural states, no area’s needs and rights are wholly ignored.

Critics argue that the system is undemocratic, as the President is technically elected by electors, not directly by the individuals (Plumer; Posner). It is true that the system can lead to an outcome where the candidate with the most popular votes nationwide does not win the election, as seen in the year 2000. However, this phenomenon has been exceedingly rare overall.

Detractors also point out the potential for Electoral College crises, including faithless electors, and an electoral tie leading to the House of Representatives determining the election result (Plumer). Yet these situations have been relatively infrequent and largely resolved without causing lasting harm to our democratic processes.

The Electoral College also resolves issues such as what could potentially happen when no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, thus avoiding the need for complicated run-off elections (Posner). More importantly, it forces presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region holds enough electoral votes to secure a victory. This compels candidates to understand and consider the needs of diverse areas across the country, making the eventual winner ""everyone's President"" (Posner).

Admittedly, the system is not perfect. The focus on swing states during the election campaigns leaves some citizens feeling ignored and potentially disinterested in voting (Plumer; Posner). However, as Posner notes, even in a system of popular vote, no single vote ever truly swings a national election.

I urge you, Senator, to deeply consider these points. The Electoral College is an invaluable mechanism that ensures a balanced, fair representation of all states in our presidential elections. It encourages candidates to appeal to a diverse range of constituents and minimizes the complexity of run-offs. This unique system, while not perfect, is deeply embedded in the democratic structure and tradition of our nation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

1512,0,"Limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages to our society, ranging from tackling issues like greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to improving public health and creating more sustainable communities. The success stories of car-free neighborhoods and cities around the world show that it is possible to live without cars and still maintain a high quality of life. By adopting smarter urban planning, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and changing cultural perceptions about car ownership, we can create a future where cars are no longer the sole means of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study cited in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" passenger cars contribute to about 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car dependency, we can make a significant impact on reducing our carbon footprint and combating climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help combat air pollution, which is a major concern in many cities around the world. In her article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" Robert Duffer discusses how Paris enforced a partial driving ban to tackle high pollution levels. The ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and highlighted the role cars play in polluting our environment. By limiting car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier cities for everyone.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also improve public health. Andrew Selsky's article ""Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota"" shows how the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, has promoted alternative transportation and encouraged people to adopt healthier habits like hiking, biking, and skating. By making our cities more walkable and accessible to public transportation, we can encourage physical activity and reduce the risk of sedentary lifestyles and related health issues.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable communities. In her article ""The End of Car Culture,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal discusses how Americans are driving less and getting fewer licenses. This cultural shift, coupled with smarter urban planning and the development of alternative transportation options, can lead to the creation of vibrant communities with improved access to amenities, reduced traffic congestion, and less reliance on fossil fuels.

While some may view limiting car usage as an inconvenience, the success stories from car-free neighborhoods and cities around the world show that it is possible to live without cars and still enjoy a high quality of life. By adopting a comprehensive approach that includes smarter urban planning, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and changing cultural perceptions about car ownership, we can create a future where cars are no longer the only means of getting around.

356,1,"Many people feel that the president plays a very imperative role in the United States. He has much responsibility and an enormous influence on what this country stands for. So, surely, this president must be carefully sought out from the abundance of other candidates. It is quite controversial as to what method is best for selecting them. Although an electoral college may appear as the right path, the countries interest invariably lies with the popular vote because it is fair and unstressful unlike the electoral college.

Firstly, the electoral college is quite unfair. It is mentioned by Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" that some of the states do not even get to see candidates under the electoral college system. Candidates don't even bother with the states that they don't have a chance of winning over. They focus all of their attention on swings states. This means that some states have to vote based on just what they have heard. These people could have heard rumors and now are voting under false impressions. They deserve their own fair share of information from the candidates themselves. Also, under the electoral college the people of this nation aren't even voting for their president. They are voting for the electors. All that they can do is hope that the person that they voted for votes in their favor Plumer. There is no guarantee that they will, so people have little say in who is president. This is their country, they should be able to decide who does and doesn't govern it. It is mentioned that with the popular vote larger states get more attention than little ones Posner. The popular vote may not be entirely fair to all states, but it most definitely is better than the electoral college. Even Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO agree that the electoral college should be abolished.

As if this wasn't enough to get rid of the electoral system, the popular vote is also much less stressful. First off, the there could be a tie. If there is a tie, the decision goes to the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is likely that the result of their voting will not be at the will of the people Plumer.

Subject: Support for the Electoral College or Transition to Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the current Electoral College system or, alternatively, to explore the possibility of transitioning to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the viewpoints presented in multiple texts, I believe that both systems have their merits, and it is crucial to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each.

The current Electoral College system, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register (""What Is the Electoral College?""), provides a fair and reliable method for electing the President. Firstly, it ensures certainty of outcome by requiring the winning candidate to obtain a majority of electoral votes. This means that the elected President must have broad support from across the country, rather than relying solely on a popular vote plurality. Furthermore, the winner-take-all nature of most states' allocation of electors promotes the idea of ""everyone's President,"" as individuals from various regions have a say in the election outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner (""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""). By focusing their efforts in these states, candidates are compelled to address issues that may otherwise go overlooked. This ensures that a wider range of concerns are taken into account during the campaign and potentially in the governance of the country.

The Electoral College also protects the interests of smaller states, as mentioned by Judge Posner. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states can have their political weight balanced by the Electoral College. This allows candidates to give attention to the needs and concerns of citizens in these states, preventing the dominance of a few populous states over the others.

On the other hand, the argument put forth by Bradford Plumer (""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"") emphasizes the need for change. Plumer contends that the electoral college is unfair to voters, as candidates often prioritize swing states and neglect others. This leads to an imbalance of attention, where only a few states have a significant role in shaping the outcome of the election. However, it is important to recognize that this issue can be addressed by reforming the current system, such as implementing a proportional representation method like that practiced in Maine and Nebraska.

While some critics of the Electoral College, like Plumer and the Gallup poll respondents cited in his text, argue for its abolition in favor of a popular vote, we must consider the potential risks and complications involved. As Judge Posner points out, a direct popular vote could lead to a run-off election if no candidate receives a majority, which would significantly complicate the election process. Moreover, a popular vote system would require careful consideration to ensure that the voices and interests of smaller states are adequately represented and balanced against those of more populous states.

In conclusion, it is essential to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of both the Electoral College and a direct popular vote system. While the Electoral College has its flaws, it provides a level of certainty, encourages a trans-regional appeal in candidates, promotes attention to swing states, allows for balanced representation of smaller states, and avoids run-off elections. However, reforms should be considered to address its shortcomings, such as implementing a proportional representation method and ensuring the needs of all citizens are taken into account.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the arguments presented and make an informed decision that best serves the interests of our state and the nation as a whole.

 on the other hand the argument put forth by Bradford Plumer the Indefensible Electoral College why even the well lay defense of the system be wrong emphasize the need for change Plumer contend that the electoral college be unfair to voter as candidate often prioritize swing state and neglect other this lead to an imbalance of attention where only a few state have a significant role in shape the outcome of the election however it be important to recognize that this issue can be address by reform the current system such as implement a proportional representation method like that practice in Maine and Nebraska 

 while some critic of the Electoral College like Plumer and the Gallup poll respondent cite in his text argue for its abolition in favor of a popular vote we must consider the potential risk and complication involve as Judge Posner point out a direct popular vote could lead to a run off election if no candidate receive a majority which would significantly complicate the election process moreover a popular vote system would require careful consideration to ensure that the voice and interest of small state be adequately represent and balance against those of more populous state 

 in conclusion it be essential to weigh the advantage and disadvantage of both the Electoral College and a direct popular vote system while the Electoral College have its flaw it provide a level of certainty encourage a trans regional appeal in candidate promote attention to swing state allow for balanced representation of small state and avoid run off election however reform should be consider to address its shortcoming such as implement a proportional representation method and ensure the need of all citizen be take into account 

 thank you for consider my perspective on this matter I trust that you will carefully evaluate the argument present and make an informed decision that good serve the interest of our state and the nation as a whole

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. After thoroughly examining the arguments from both sides, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be preserved for the following reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner of the electoral vote usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a disputed outcome is lower compared to a direct popular vote. Stability and legitimacy are crucial in any democratic process, and the Electoral College provides this by avoiding prolonged election disputes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of having a president who represents all regions of the country, not just specific areas with high population density. As Judge Posner argues, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College guarantees that the president will consider the interests and concerns of all regions, preventing regional disenfranchisement.

Additionally, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, which results in a more engaged and informed electorate. The system incentivizes candidates to pay attention to states that can swing either way, leading to more thoughtful and informed voters. This ensures that the election outcome is not solely determined by a few heavily populated states, but rather by a wide range of states with diverse priorities and perspectives.

Moreover, the Electoral College gives weight to the political balance of large states. As mentioned by Judge Posner, large states receive more attention from presidential candidates due to their greater number of electoral votes. This mechanism balances the influence of small and large states, enabling candidates to address the concerns of both densely populated urban areas and less populated rural areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which simplifies and streamlines the presidential election process. The Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, preventing prolonged periods of uncertainty or the need for additional voting rounds. By avoiding run-off elections, the system promotes efficiency and maintains the democratic principles of representative government.

While some argue that the winner-take-all system of the Electoral College can lead to candidates ignoring states they have no chance of winning, it is important to note that candidates have limited campaign resources and must prioritize areas where they have the greatest opportunity for success. The Electoral College ensures that candidates focus on competitive states, giving a fair chance for all voices to be heard.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, representation, engagement, balance, and efficiency in the presidential election process. It guarantees a clear outcome, ensures presidential representation for all regions, promotes thoughtful voter participation, balances the interests of small and large states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College and to support its continuation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Subject: Keeping the Electoral College for Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College for presidential elections. While I acknowledge that there are some valid concerns and criticisms of the Electoral College system, I believe that it plays a crucial role in our democracy and should be retained.

The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, and a candidate needs a majority of 270 electoral votes to be elected President. This system ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election and prevents larger states from dominating the process.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. In a country as diverse as ours, with different regions and varying interests, it is crucial to have a system that requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College ensures that no single region can elect a President on its own, encouraging candidates to develop broad-based platforms and appeal to a wide range of voters.

Moreover, the winner-take-all method used by most states encourages candidates to campaign in swing states and pay attention to the concerns of voters in those states. This allows for a more focused and substantive campaign, as candidates are motivated to address the specific issues facing these swing states. It also ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who tend to pay closer attention to the campaign, have a greater say in deciding the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power held by large states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as outlined in the Constitution, gives smaller states an equal representation. The Electoral College allows larger states to regain some of their weight, as the number of electoral votes is determined by a state's population. This ensures that presidential candidates cannot ignore the concerns and interests of voters in large states, even if they may have a more concentrated campaign strategy in swing states.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process and lead to prolonged uncertainty. By producing a clear winner, it maintains the stability and efficiency of our elections, ensuring a smooth transition of power.

While there are certainly criticisms of the Electoral College, such as the winner-take-all system and the potential for faithless electors, these issues can be addressed with reforms that preserve the overall framework. For example, implementing proportional representation in all states would distribute elector votes more accurately and address concerns about the winner-take-all system.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in ensuring that our presidential elections are fair, representative, and balanced. It guarantees a trans-regional appeal for candidates, incentivizes campaigns to focus on swing states, balances the power of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While reforms may be necessary, the underlying system should be preserved for the sake of our democracy.

Thank you for considering my perspective. I hope that you will continue to support the Electoral College and work towards reforms that improve its functionality.

803,1,"Dear Florida state senator, I highly suggest we keep the Electoral College for many reasons, I believe to be the most valued being, with Electoral College, we can insure the certainty and fariness of the outcome. Majority of states award electoral votes with a winner takes all, type of deal. For instance, when no candidate has majority of vote, it becomes a bit of a hectic presidential election, but by using Electoral College, the result is a clear winner. Also, it is insured that there is no region that has enough electoral votes to elect a president alone. Which is great! If a candidate was eligible to be elected by a single regions appeal, that president is extremely unlikely to be a successful president.

Many people believe that Electoral college is unfair, they claim that the candidates feel they dont have to spend much time in the states that they feel they have no chance of winning in, but in reality, instead of avoid the states the candidates feel they wont get votes from, they should probably campaign there, and try to win some votes. It's about making the people like you, making them want to vote for you, not feel avoided by you, and if the candidates still dont see it that way, Electoral College has solved this problem by incorporating ""Swing States."" Voters in these tossup states listen extremely closely to the competing candidates. These voting are often the most thoughtful because they know they are going to be the deciding factor in the election.

because no region of voters can decide the election, and there is even a deciding factor of thoughtful people who are listening closely to the election, Electoral College becomes not only the fairest, but also the most successful way to elect a president.",0,"dear Florida state senator I highly suggest we keep the Electoral College for many reason I believe to be the most value being with Electoral College we can insure the certainty and fariness of the outcome majority of states award electoral vote with a winner take all type of deal for instance when no candidate have majority of vote it become a bit of a hectic presidential election but by use Electoral College the result be a clear winner also it be insure that there be no region that have enough electoral vote to elect a president alone which be great if a candidate be eligible to be elect by a single region appeal that president be extremely unlikely to be a successful president

In vaughn's streets they influenced people to not drive their cars or own a car so they would not pay have to pay 40,000 for a garage to store in their car, including a home. Over all vaughn's streets are car free, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own a car and 50 percent sold a car to move there. When a place becomes car free it leaves more space for walking and less space for parking.

Paris enforced to ban driving to clear the air of the global city. Drivers would have to leave their cars at home if they had odd or even numbered license plates or pay a 22euro fine. Car traffic decreased to 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smog. Exceptions were made for plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transportation was free from Friday to Monday. Paris has more smog than other European capitals. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday.

Carfree day is a program in Bogota, Colombiait began in the mid1990s. The program is meaning to spread to other countries and the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. colombians did a variety or activities as a use of transportation hiking, biking, skating, taking buses, taxis to work on carfree day. Streets were more clear. When Colombians drove cars on this day they would pay a 25 fine. Two cities from Colombia, Cali and Valledupar joined this event, people would still participate despite the weather condition they were in. Changes were occurring, parks and sports centers were blooming in the city, uneven sidewalks were replaced by smooth sidewalks, new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

President Obama's goals were to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies say that Americans are buying and driving less cars and licenses are decreasing as each year goes by. The rise of cellphones and carpolling apps has facilitated and more commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. New York's biking program bridges and tunnel tolls reflect new priorites as of carsharing programs accross the nation. People have used other kinds of transportation instead of using their own. Mr. Sivak's son lives in San Fransico and owns a car but uses Bay Area Rapid Transit. A study has shown that fewer people have found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 20012009.

You waste money on gas for your car. There is another way of transportation you could take to arrive to your destination to save money. You could go car polling with a friend or take the communities cheap transportation. Using a bike is also a simple transportation and walking...most people are capable of walking.

931,1,"The United States is a democratic country where the people decide on a leader through voting, or so it's supposed to be. We Americans use something called the Electoral College, where a state is worth a certain amount of points, and when you win that state for your party, you gain those points. I find this to be unfair, because you could win by popular vote, but lose because the opposing party won the states with the biggest number of points. I think that the Electoral College should be removed and replaced with popular vote only. It would make elections more fair, and it would make peoples' votes feel like they change something.

When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, and humans aren't the most honest things on Earth. Also, there is the feeling of being important that you get when you think that you could tip the scale, it makes you feel special, and in control of your own country. What's the point of voting if there's a chance it might not matter, because the other party just won California, the state with the most amount of points, 55, and you couldn't do anything because you live in Idaho or North Dakota, with only three little points. Popular vote would make you feel involved, and happy to help.

As I stated before, each state has an amount of points based on the population, which in turn affect how much you help your desired party. Seems reasonable, right? You would think that the more the population, the more impact it has on the election. That's right, but it's also unfair because states that have noone living there could all vote for one party, but it wouldn't help that much, unless the points were close and that state tipped the scale. But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematically try to win the largest behind ""the Big Four"". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot.

In America, the people should be able to feel responsible for their country's future, and not feel as if their state doesn't matter. My own words might not be able to change peoples' minds, but I'm sure the votes aren't tied.",0,"the United States be a democratic country where the people decide on a leader through voting or so it be suppose to be we Americans use something call the Electoral College where a state be worth a certain amount of point and when you win that state for your party you gain those point I find this to be unfair because you could win by popular vote but lose because the oppose party win the state with the big number of point I think that the Electoral College should be remove and replace with popular vote only it would make election more fair and it would make people vote feel like they change something

 as I state before each state have an amount of point base on the population which in turn affect how much you help your desire party seem reasonable right you would think that the more the population the more impact it have on the election that be right but it be also unfair because state that have noone live there could all vote for one party but it would n't help that much unless the point be close and that state tip the scale but big state like California Texas and Florida have some of the most point so if you be to win those you already have more than one hundred point candidate would try to just seek out those jumbo prize and systematically try to win the large behind the Big Four if someone be read this and want the Electoral College they could say that the big state would still have an advantage with more voter and that be right but they would n't be as big of prize so the election turn from a voice of the people speak up for a new leader and turn into a mad chase to get the big prize before the other party like a game of Monopoly in Monopoly you buy area with your money and when someone land on that space you own they have to pay you the place ath the end of the board have the pricy cost but the good outcome you can also build property on space to make the enemy player pay more if you be to buy those you practically win the game on the other hand the space at the begining be basiclly worthless cost about 100 dollar and give you about 1000 those be like the small state that have almost no value to the election and the big state be worth a lot 

 in America the people should be able to feel responsible for their country 's future and not feel as if their state do n't matter my own word might not be able to change people mind but I be sure the vote be n't tie"
656,0,"The car is a staple in modern day society by many standards, it represents wealth, societal rank however on the more negative side of the matter cars are the result of a majority of deaths in the United States. Alongside the fatalities, cars also pollute the environment that is so very delicate. The benefits of becoming carfree are immense and far outweigh the ""negatives"" that come alongside living without cars.

Cars as many people know see them are recognized for their glamour and attraction, but what is forgotten somewhere in the infatuation with cars is the true devastation they can cause. Cars in the United States and many other countries around the world account for a majority of the fatalities in total. Living without cars would completely irradiate the fatalities due to cars as well as reducing the stress that comes along with having such a hefty responsibility.

Along with the potential danger to humans, in the United States cars are the second largest source of emissions right behind power plants according to paragraph 34. Countries like India and China are among the top few most polluted cities on this planet now imagine the impact of implementing a carfree law. The amount of pollution would go down immensely and the effect that this would have on the lifespan of people living in those countries would be incredulous. Some will argue that this will negatively have a change on their life. And to that I would say, are you willing to sacrifice some of the comfort that a car supplies you for a better life for your children and grandchildren?

The amount of money that would be saved from living a carfree life would be incredible. Without having to pay car payments, car insurance, and gas fees every month imagine what this money could be going towards. Removing such a monetary factor would reap such high rewards that so many would agree is completely worth some of the sacrifices that would have to be made.

459,1,"The electoral collage should be disbanded. Not only is it unfair to minority party voters, but it also is unreliable.

The electoral collage consists of people voting for an elector, which in turn votes for a presedent. This may sound like a good idea, but in reality, it overcomplicated and scrambles things. This has lead to a less wanted candidate able to win the election. During 2000, presidential candidate Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but not the presidency, due to the process of voting for the electors, rather than the presidents. This led to Al Gore recieving 266 electoral votes, and George W. Bush winning 271, therefore electing a less popular president. Not only that, but the electors being voted for may not even vote for the candidate they say they will.

The winnertakesall strategy was placed to reduce the chance of ties and have the candidates focus on taking over the swingstate votes, but an unintended consequence was the reduction of voting from minory party votes, for example, when a Democrat in Texas or a Republican in New York votes, they hardly get any say, and therefore may stop voting. A popular vote for presidency would alleviate this problem and make it able for anyone from a state to have an equal voice in the state.

Popular vote would lead to members of different states having the same amount of power, while the electoral collage leads to unequal representation. Because of the Senate's two representatives per state, people in less populous states have more power. For example, California has 2 Senate representatives and 35 million voters, and Wyoming, with a much smaller population, has the same amount of representatives in the Senate, leading to a Wyoming resident having much more than a Californian one.

All in all, the ellectoral collage is a bad idea. Not only does it ensure inequallity, but it also leads to inaccurate voting and discrimination against a voter who votes for a minority statewide candidate.

2082,1,"Dear Senator [Name],

I am writing to you as a concerned citizen in regard to the methods by which we choose our country's highest leader. There has been extensive debate recently about whether the United States should maintain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for electing our president. While both systems have their merits and drawbacks, I am persuaded in favor of retaining the Electoral College.

The Electoral College, contrary to many opinions, brings distinct benefits to our national and state politics. It gives some weightage to smaller states and maintains a balance between densely populated urban areas and less-populated rural regions, which ensures that all voices are heard and respected (Posner 19-21). Each state, regardless of its population density, offers significant contribution to the national electoral process and thus supports the trans-regional appeal that a candidate should possess (Posner 19). If we shift to a pure popular vote system, I fear it may lead to the alienation of smaller states and rural areas that do not have gigantic population counts like the urban metropolises.

However, in acknowledgement of the counterclaim, it is true that the current system can result in situations where a candidate can win the popular vote yet lose the presidency due to electoral votes distribution (Plumer 9). It is a legitimate concern, but the instances are indeed rare and this should not be a reason to abolish the system entirely; rather we could consider much-needed improvements (Posner 16). 

In light of the complaints regarding the 'winner-take-all' system that results in candidates focusing solely on swing states (Plumer 13), it is undeniable that this factor can feel discouraging for voters in states where a particular party's victory is almost certain. However, Posner argues that this system inspires voters in these key states to be more attentive and thoughtful throughout the campaign, which is beneficial for the overall health of our democracy (Posner 20). 

Furthermore, the Electoral College protects us from scenarios where no candidate receives a majority vote, which could result in complicated run-off elections (Posner 22). The system generally provides clear outcomes with a defined winner, which is vital for maintaining the stability and order in our country.

Given these considerations, while the Electoral College may seem undemocratic at face value, it becomes clear upon closer examination that this system brings important balance and structure to our presidential elections. Improvements may be needed, but to abolish the system in favor of direct elections could lead to new issues and complications. I therefore urge you to support the retention and reform, rather than abolition, of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your consideration.

1235,0,"All over the world, major cities are trying to reduce their use of cars. From Germany, to France, to Columbia, and coming back to the US, people are limiting car use to reduce pollution, or live better, or even to save money. In some places, there is one day every year that doesn't allow cars. In other places, there are whole communities that dont allow cars year round.

In Germany, there is a community in named Vauban that doesnt allow cars unless you have the money to pay for a parking spot that is on the outskirts of town. The revolutionizing community makes peopl pay 40, 000 dollars just for one parking spot. This wonderful new place has reduced the amount of greenhouse gas produced in the last few years drastically, with 70% of the population not owning a car. This has encouraged many other countries to start something just like it.

The city of love may not be so lovely if it's so smoggy you can barely see. Paris was gaining so much air pollution from the amount of gas that was released from driving hta they put a ban on driving. This ban consisted of a few new rules to help prevent the smog from overpowering the beauty of the city. On Mondays, even numbered license plates were not allowed to use their car for anything. This same rule applied to the odd numbered license plates on Tuesdays. This helped limit the amount of driving, in return limiting the amount of smog. Smog is created when the area has cold night weather and warm day weather, causing the air to trap car emission. Diesel can be a big contributor to this and is the main gas type in France. France favors diesel because of their taxing system, but it seems they don't care too much about their environment.

What would happen if every country had a day with no cars? The city of Bogota, Columbia has had a Day without cars once a year for quite a few years. Just recently, other columbian cities have joined in and even Paraguay's capital has participated. What this day is supposed to do is promote the use of other types of transportation, for example walking or biking. It also reduces smog and the amount of air pollution, in retaliation, improving the city. In Bogota, there is a 25 fine for those who do not participate in this environmentally helpful day.

Although the amount of driving in the US has decreased since 2005, there is more we can do to help the situation. The average number of miles driven did peak in 2005 and drop from there, in return, dropping other statistics as well. As of April of 2013, the number of driven miles has dropped 9% below the peak, being the same as in January of 1995, says Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives. The roads have even become safer due to the amount of young drivers dropping 23% between the years of 20012009. Even if the number of miles hadn't peaked, there still wouldn't be as many drivers on the road because of the recession. Americans couldn't afford to but cars due to the amount of money lost during that horrible time.

All through the world, people are trying to slowly save their environment by reducung car use. From one day to a whole year, everything helps to save our world. The German community of Vauban has made it nearly impossible to own a car. Paris, at one point, had to put restrictions on their driving. Columbia has an annual day of no cars. The US is working on lowering thier use of cars and dropping their average miles to help clear the air surrounding them. Even if it is walking from point A to point B, it helps the community and lowers air pollution.",0,"all over the world major city be try to reduce their use of car from Germany to France to Columbia and come back to the US people be limit car use to reduce pollution or live well or even to save money in some place there be one day every year that do n't allow car in other place there be whole community that do nt allow car year round

2,0,"""America's love affair with it's vehicles seems to be cooling"" says Elisabeth rosenthal. To understand rosenthal's perspective, it is easier to suggest that America's car usage is decreasing slowly. This isn't necessarily bad in the sense that it has certain positive effects. The advantages of limiting car usage includes an increase in security and health, along with a decrease in pollution and dependence.

Firstly, when car usage is limited security and health is more likely to be guaranteed. The feeling of being secure is highly important to individuals everywhere. For example, many people in colombia used public transportation during a car free day ""leaving the streets of this capital city "", according to Andrew Selsky, ""eerily devoid of traffic jams"". The complications that stem from traffic jams end with a feeling of confidence. The plan to get from point A to B was more simple just a second ago. This complication in your personal plans leads you to become stressed as a feeling of doubt overcomes all thoughts. If car usage was limited, there would be a control on how much traffic accumulates thus minimizing chance of stress. As Heidrun Walter states ""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". not only does car usage minimize conditions detrimental to health, it also enlarges your capacity for exercise. The main purpose of the car is to get someone from one place to another. when an important job takes over your personal life, it becomes difficult to do things most enjoyed in life. limits on car usage forces you to stay in shape. According to Andrew Selsky ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city"". Less cars means healthier and natural situations. With parks and sport centers becoming more efficient, it becomes easier to find a more physically active population. Overall, less usage on cars minimizes stress and increases health.

Secondly, limting car usage becomes beneficial to the environment. Now a days people have become annoyed with others who care so passionately about the environment. If you look behind their constant cries for action, there are solid facts. Yespollution is bad for the environment. Yes a bad envorment means unhealthy living. Yes cars are one of the main contributors to pollution in the environment. A pattern of less car usage, as Elisabeth Rosenthal states ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"". The less use of cars, the less pollution in the environment. One must observe limiting car usage as an opportunity to create a cleaner world and better future. The effects of pollution in the environment is completley dangerous and we, the car users, are to blame.

Additionally, it would lower the dependence on cars. Many people today find that their car is so useful. While it has many features and is a form of transportation, many do not figure what they would do if they did not have such a possesion. The development of people and their interaction with technology has left a wide gap between historic, natural ways and what is thought of as modern society. Being dependent is not always good for individuals. As david goldberg says ""all our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"". Many people could disagree and wonder why it is necessary to change our ways especially if we are so highly devloped. If being developed means being dependent on a harmful machine, then it could not be effective devlopment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal ""cashstrapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed were't going to work anyway"". Many people can't have the precious luxury of private transportation in the first place. Those who have had it have become distant to a more natural society. Peope have become so use to having cars that they have become oblivious to the significant effects. With limits on car usage , these effcts could be controlled.

To conclude, the advantages of limiting car usage is an increase in health, along with a decrease in pollution, and less dependence on cars. limiting car usage is a positive way to enfore an organized and clean environment, and ensure health and security of those who live in it. This is one reason America can be reffered to as a succesful country. It is not that America has decreased use of vehicles, but the fact that they have done what is best for majority.",0,"America 's love affair with it 's vehicle seem to be cool say Elisabeth rosenthal to understand rosenthal 's perspective it be easy to suggest that America 's car usage be decrease slowly this be n't necessarily bad in the sense that it have certain positive effect the advantage of limit car usage include an increase in security and health along with a decrease in pollution and dependence

221,0,"Cars are becoming a dying trend all over the world. More and more people choose to walk, ride bikes, take busses, or use alternative forms of transportation. Car companies seem to be losing business also. With more and more drives becoming pedestrians each day, it seems that private automobiles will soon be replaced by the old method of transportation, walking. This new option of transportation seems to be becoming a trend everywhere.

Less cars means less pollution. Major cities that are filled with cars seem be becoming more and more polluted each day. Big cities such as paris have taken major action, such as to temporarily ban driving, to reduce smog production. An article from the Chicago Tribune states""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""10. Pollution is becoming a big problem all over the world. Alternative transportation is one way you can help stop the pollution all over the world.

More exercise is allowed without cars. without cars, people are forced to get up and move to their destination instead of just sitting down your whole life. Obesity is becoming a big problem now all over the world but it has a very big impact in America. More people need more exercise and getting rid of cars is an excellent solution. Even with riding a bus, you would have to get up and walk to the bus stop. Alternative transportation could be the new big thing in exercise.

You can save money without a car. Due to inflation, cars cost a ludacris amount of money in modern day. People spend their whole lives trying to pay off an automobile. Not only do you have to pay off the Automobile itself but you must also pay for the gas, parts, and tools that come with it, which price continues to rise. It is also getting harder to find money and jobs as unemployment also rises while many salaries fall. It is very important to save your money and current day and maybe spend it on something more useful than an automobile.

As automobiles begin to become scarce among many counties, more and more benefits come with alternative transportation. The benefits of being able to save money, the ability to get in physical shape and to exercise more, and the ability to be smog free are all extremely important in today's society and environment. Automobile businesses are even thinking of partnering with other companies that produce products such as bikes, busses, or even making more sidewalks for pedestrians with alternative transportation. Our economy may be falling but our enviorment is flourishing. Giving up cars and Alternative transportaion may be the next big thing.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my support for the Electoral College system and urge you to consider its value in our presidential election process. While some argue for a switch to a popular vote, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is crucial for the following reasons:

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As demonstrated in the 2012 election, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This helps to prevent disputes over the outcome and promotes a smoother transition of power. Additionally, the winner-take-all system used in most states creates a landslide electoral-vote victory, further solidifying the legitimacy and clarity of the result.

Secondly, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. In a vast country like ours, it is essential for a president to represent and understand the interests of all regions. By requiring candidates to have widespread support across different states, the Electoral College ensures that no single region holds enough electoral votes to determine the outcome. This fosters a presidency that is inclusive and representative of the entire nation, preventing candidates from solely focusing on regions where they have a clear advantage.

Thirdly, the Electoral College gives importance to swing states and ensures that the most thoughtful and informed voters have a significant impact on the election. Toss-up states attract the candidates' attention and resources, resulting in a more engaged electorate that carefully considers the issues and candidates. This system allows for a more comprehensive campaign strategy that targets the concerns of diverse regions and effectively addresses the needs of the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College maintains a fair balance between large and small states. The system compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate, where large states lose some weight due to equal representation. By allocating electoral votes based on a state's population, candidates are compelled to pay attention to the concerns and interests of both large and small states. This helps prevent a scenario where a few densely populated areas dominate the discourse and allows for a more inclusive representation of the nation as a whole.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections that can complicate the election process. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This eliminates the requirement for additional rounds of voting, which can create logistical challenges and prolong the time it takes to finalize the election results.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the high voter turnout in the 2012 election indicates that voters are motivated by expressing their political preference rather than solely focusing on swing states. Additionally, by maintaining a state-based system, the unique concerns and interests of each state can be better represented, promoting a more diverse and balanced presidency.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system preserves certainty, encourages trans-regional appeal, strengthens swing state involvement, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. These reasons, among others, highlight the importance of maintaining this system in our presidential election process.

I respectfully urge you to advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College, as it continues to be a vital component in our democratic system. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your ongoing commitment to upholding the principles that have guided our great nation for centuries.

422,1,"I believe that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or opposite party. Also the problem comes up that the candidates do no go to there state thus never seeing them.

To began with I believe we should remove the Electoral Colleges. For the reason that voter are not voting but for a slate of electors. Who then elect the president, for example ""if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry. You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.""qoute form source 2 Those 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry may not win the statewide election. The voters also are not always able to control who there electors vote for. ""Legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" qoute form source 2. So there a chance they may change there mind and the president they wished to win may not win because the legislatures do not have to vote in there favor. In some case seventeen states didn't even see the candidates at all. Some states including Rhode Island and South Carolina, ""and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Also another reason why we should remove the Electoral Colleges is for the reason that voters may become confuse and vote for the wrong person.

furthermore we should remove the Electors Colleges, because its unfair to the voters. For example the winner takes all system in each state. Candidates don't spend times in the states they know they have no chance winning. ""It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" qoute from source 3. But then what happens to the people in that wants to vote for them but can't because there votes go toward a slate of electors that votes for the other party. They focus on the swing states mostly. For Instance a Presidential race that happen were the electoral votes caused a certain party to win was. In 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Hore received more in dividual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. The electoral votes need to be removed because it causes problems in elections which makes any side able to win even though they don't have more individual votes. Another example is ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast on him."" qoute from sorce 3. Study shows that 60% of voters would prefer a direct election rather then what they have now.

On the other hand having the electoral votes may not be such a bad thing. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College also restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states. If you elect a good representive that you believe, and trust that will vote to your liking. Someone that would not turn his back on the will of the people then it would not be that bad. The process they go throught maybe difficult and hard to understand. So it could be a good thing they take the hard work off our backs and do it for us to save us the time and hardwork. The Electoral Colleges requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal rather then a single region appeal.

To conclude I believe that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

858,1,"To whome this may concern the electoral college is out dated and unfair. Examples of this would be that bias can take up a big part of it. For example if an electoral does not like who is running for president on the winning side they can bend the votes into there favor. Another example would be in the case of a tie the election would be given to the house of representatives witch would be another unfair vote, because each representative stands for everyone in the state. So if the representative in MA was demcrait and the representative in TX was republican then the morty vote would most likely go to the republicans.

Other examples of how unfair the system is the ""winner take all"" system. Reasons it is unfair is that the the running candidates don't go to states if they no they are going to win or not. Some states don't even get to see the adds for some candidates because that stat morty is either repubclain or democrat. That is unfair to the people that are in the opposite party in that state. Futher more the system is unfair to people in states where the morty is something different from the party they are in.

Last but not least the system is out dated. The electoral college has been around since the constution was writen but since then it has gone down hill with the bias and morty votes. Examples of this can be found int the two parragraphs above as well as in this one. Another example why is out dated and unfair is the people most likely do not have a say in who they pick. a reason for this would be the bias the members of the electoral have to a candidate. The vote they cast has a grater power over ours and can sway the vote to there favor is they want to. More reasons would be how the electoral college has been around since the constution. although other systems from that time still seem to work this one does not and it will continue to fail until it just stops working altogether.

In concluestion the electoral college needs to be changed due to the bias in the system along with the unfairness of the system. Also the age of the system and the fact that it seems to keep failing,And not showing any signs that it will get better. Or help with elections in a fair and approiate way.

1249,0,"There are many advantages in limiting the amount of car usage. Many people seem to believe that if you do not drive everywhere, you can preserve the land and it is proven to reduce stress. Another advantage would be that the government wouldn't have to spend as much money on highways and other transport. There is a lot less congestion, and polution without the use of cars. These are all good examples of how reducing the use of cars could be very good for the environment.

To expand on the theory that a carfree cities are a lot better for the environment, we can say they preserve lands and cause stress levels to be reduced. In the first article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", Heidrun Walter is quoted explaining that he is ""much happier"" without a car in his life. He also states that when he did have a car, he was ""alway tense"". This seems to show stress levels going down, but that is only one example. In addition to stress levels, land preservation was also brought up. It is stated that without cars, roads and suburbs would be nicer and better for walking. Without cars, cities are also considered denser. Researchers are trying to conduct an experiment with a no car city and see how different and ""better"" life would be, to get more facts about it.

Next, this carfree world could help save the government money. Studies show that in recent years, eighty percent of appropriations have gone to fixing and preserving highways for cars to continue driving on them safely. In addition to that eighty percent, twenty percent was provided for all the other ways for transportation, for example, buses. Without cars, we would be saving the government eighty percent of their money, holding on to the idea that areas would be kept in good shape without cars driving on them! Thats crazy!

Lastly, polution is a HUGE factor in this idea. Without cars, we would have a lot less polution and smog. In France, they have a few carfree cities and they states that without cars, sixty percent of smog levels went down in only 5 days! Fuel is blaimed for a lot of polution dailey and without cars, we could have a cleaner air and city in only a few days!

In conclusion, carfree cities could be a very good idea for some cities. We can make the air better, having less smog, spend less money, and have nicer land. These are only a few of the advantages to having a carless city.",0,"there be many advantage in limit the amount of car usage many people seem to believe that if you do not drive everywhere you can preserve the land and it be prove to reduce stress another advantage would be that the government would n't have to spend as much money on highway and other transport there be a lot less congestion and polution without the use of car these be all good example of how reduce the use of car could be very good for the environment

1316,0,"In the world that we live in now, many people use cars to get around like getting to work, schooling, and some just go for fun, or the experience of it. In our world, these vehicles are causing a very big issue in our lives. Cars are not great for our environment, without them we would be able to be more ecofriendly, be healthier, and keep eachother more safe. Cars are not the only way to get around!

Using cars may help up get around more often, but notice how many accidents people get into. Running into someones bumper, not being carefull, and some times even driving under the influence, are all very dangerous ways you can get injured in a car. Vehicles are a way to get around quickly, but imagine being stuck in traffic for hours and only moved a mile because someone was not paying attention and ran into a street light. We were born with feet to walk. Walking short distances to the store, or market, where ever you wish to go is better than being stuck in a pile of reckless drivers. You can get there in a safer mannor than you would if you were to take a car.

There are plenty of way to get around, other than cars suck as bikes, any kind of skateboards, rollerblades, bicycling, there is a whole list. Not only do these help the environment, but they give you a nice workout. Most do it for their health, some to help them achieve a goal. A simple walk to the store, can help with a plethora of thing that are very important to your body. While doing this healthy habit, you get plenty of fresh air, with can reduce stress, and help your body in ways that will give you a feeling a peace in mind.

Without using cars, the gas that they realese will not bother our environment. As said in source 1, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of green house gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the US."" 50%? Thats half! If these gasses continue to damage our environment, our world will be very unclean.

For generations, cars were known to impress. Even now, people still have cars shows, or gatherings to display their vehicles. The better your car was, the more attention you were receiving. On the other hand, many people have chosen to take the better way out of it and find other ways to get out of using them. Car pooling is another option.

1161,0,"Cars are very important to the life of a modern person. The car gets you where you need to go in the time that you want to go in. There are ways to limit car usage and still get your transportation to where you need to go. There are some advantages to not using cars all the time. One advantage is that if we stop using cars, then pollution will drop drastically. Another advantage to us not using cars is that we get plenty of exercise while we do other things than just sit in our cars.

Paris, France. Known for being the city of love, but doesn't have a certain love for cars. They banned car usage after days of nearrecord pollutionsource 2 paragraph 10. In order to make sure that the residents don't use their cars still the placed a 22euro fine 31 for anyone still drivingsource 2 paragraph 11. After only just a few days, congestion was down almost 60 percent in the capital of France source 2 paragraph 14. In the United States, most kids these days aren't driving as much as they used to. They are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses each year source 4 paragraph 29. If this keeps up, then lot of sociologist think that this will have a huge effect on the environment, which will lead to the end of pollution problemssource 4 paragraph 34. This advantage of having less car usage will not only help the earth, but it also will help the things on the earth including us humans and animals.

The final advantage that limiting car usage is that we will have plenty of exercise. A mother of two that had a car but the sold it in Germany said "" When i had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way""source 1 paragraph 3. She usually walks down the street to and from wherever she goes. exercising is great for your health and you can just start by walking, biking, skating, roller blading and many more ways to get to where you need to go. In Bogota, Columbia millions of people hiked , biked, skated, or took buses to work source 3 paragraph 20. ""It's good opportunity to take away stress..."" source 3 paragraph 24 said businessman Carlos arturo Plaze when he was asked about the banning of cars for the third straight year in Germany source 3 paragraph 24. Stress isn't good for your health and excercising is great on removing that stress from your body. Excersisng is a great advantage to limited car usage because you reduce stress, work out, and feel better all while you get to where you need to go at the same time.

The advantages that everyone gets from limited car usage is that the pollution will go down, and you get better exercise. If pollution goes down then you will have a better earth for everyone to enjoy, but you can't enjoy the earth if it's congested with polutted air. You also get great exercise when you walk, bike, skate to wherever you need to go instead of sitting in a car to go to your destination.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and the methods of electing the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information provided in various texts, it is my belief that we should maintain the system of the Electoral College, rather than switching to a popular vote-based election. While both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, the Electoral College serves as a more practical and balanced approach for several reasons.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As outlined in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome is lower compared to a popular vote-based system. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states also ensures that a slight plurality in a state can create a significant electoral vote victory. This level of certainty in the outcome of the election helps maintain stability and legitimacy in the electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal and consider the interests of different regions. As Judge Posner argues, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Therefore, candidates must appeal to a wider range of voters and take into account the interests and concerns of citizens across the country. This fosters a sense of national unity and ensures that the president represents the diverse needs of the entire nation, rather than just one specific region.

The Electoral College also benefits from the presence of swing states. As outlined by Judge Posner, winner-take-all methods encourage candidates to focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states. This not only ensures that these states receive more attention, but it also encourages voters in those states to pay closer attention to the campaign and be more thoughtful in their decision-making. Swing states play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the election, and their influence helps make the process more democratic and representative of the people's choices.

In addition, the Electoral College helps balance the political weight of large and small states. As discussed by Judge Posner, the mal-apportionment of the Senate gives more weight to small states in the popular vote. The Electoral College restores some of this balance by considering both population size and state representation. This ensures that candidates pay attention to both large and small states during their campaign, preventing large states from dominating the electoral process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. As seen in previous elections, such as Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College has the ability to produce a clear winner even with a plurality of the popular vote. This eliminates the need for additional rounds of voting, which could complicate and prolong the presidential election process.

While I understand the argument for a popular vote-based system, where each individual's vote carries equal weight, I believe that the Electoral College offers a more balanced and practical method of electing the President of the United States. It ensures that the outcome is certain, encourages trans-regional appeal, promotes the importance of swing states, balances the political weight of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this matter. I hope that you will continue to support the maintenance of the Electoral College system, which has proven to be an effective and fair method of electing the President of the United States.

 Dear Senator 's name 

 I be write to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and the method of elect the President of the United States after carefully consider the information provide in various text it be my belief that we should maintain the system of the Electoral College rather than switch to a popular vote base election while both method have their advantage and disadvantage the Electoral College serve as a more practical and balanced approach for several reason 

 one of the main advantage of the Electoral College system be the certainty of outcome that it provide as outline in Judge Richard A. Posner 's article the win candidate 's share of the Electoral College tend to exceed their share of the popular vote this mean that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome be low compare to a popular vote base system the winner take all method of award electoral vote in most state also ensure that a slight plurality in a state can create a significant electoral vote victory this level of certainty in the outcome of the election help maintain stability and legitimacy in the electoral process 

 furthermore the Electoral College encourage presidential candidate to have trans regional appeal and consider the interest of different region as Judge Posner argue no single region have enough electoral vote to elect a president therefore candidate must appeal to a wide range of voter and take into account the interest and concern of citizen across the country this foster a sense of national unity and ensure that the president represent the diverse need of the entire nation rather than just one specific region 

 the Electoral College also benefit from the presence of swing state as outline by Judge Posner winner take all method encourage candidate to focus their campaign effort on toss up state this not only ensure that these state receive more attention but it also encourage voter in those state to pay close attention to the campaign and be more thoughtful in their decision making swing state play a crucial role in decide the outcome of the election and their influence help make the process more democratic and representative of the people 's choice 

 in addition the Electoral College help balance the political weight of large and small state as discuss by Judge Posner the mal apportionment of the Senate give more weight to small state in the popular vote the Electoral College restore some of this balance by consider both population size and state representation this ensure that candidate pay attention to both large and small state during their campaign prevent large state from dominate the electoral process 

 lastly the Electoral College avoid the need for run off election in case where no candidate receive a majority of the vote cast as see in previous election such as Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 the Electoral College have the ability to produce a clear winner even with a plurality of the popular vote this eliminate the need for additional round of voting which could complicate and prolong the presidential election process 

 while I understand the argument for a popular vote base system where each individual 's vote carry equal weight I believe that the Electoral College offer a more balanced and practical method of elect the President of the United States it ensure that the outcome be certain encourage trans regional appeal promote the importance of swing state balance the political weight of large and small state and avoid the need for run off election 

 thank you for take the time to consider my perspective on this matter I hope that you will continue to support the maintenance of the Electoral College system which have prove to be an effective and fair method of elect the President of the United States

867,0,"CarFree Cities Humans almost feel the need to own a car almost as much as they feel the need to own a phone. The automobile industry has been a growing industry since World War 2. There are so many advantages to limiting car usage. Saving on gas and getting good exercise are just a few of the great advantages of limiting car usage.

Vauban, Germany understands that according to Source 1 which talks about how they have given up their cars! Not only is it saving them a ton of money on gas, car insurance, car payments, and fixing parts, it also gives them all great exercise. If everyone walks everywhere everyday the whole city will be fit in no time. Another advantage to the loss of cars, no car accidents. 180,000 people die a year due to car accidents. The death's in this city will be reduced drastically due to no cars. This no car movement is a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere as a component of a movement called ""smart planning"".

Source 2 talks about how Paris has banned driving due to smog. Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France. Delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. The advantages of limiting car usage here is the you'd never have to worry about there being smog outside or snow etc. Limiting car usage, you wouldn't have to worry about the weather being so terrible that you can't drive in smog or heavy rain and have a car accident.

Bogota, Colombia joins the no car movement for what is known as ""CarFree Day"". Source 3 discusses the day without cars in Bogota, Colombia. It is an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It's seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to their city's mayor. Limiting car usage in this city could be great for a lot of reasons. One being they are the only LatinAmerican city to have covered 118 miles of bicycle paths. Their parks and sports centers are now blooming throughout the city. It's uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.

Source 4 talks about the End of Car Culture. Studies have shown that as the years go on, driving is becoming less and less popular which is sad for many automobile industries worldwide. In America, the partial cause of the decrease in car usage is the unemployment rate being so low, it's not like someone has to go to work. Gas is becoming to expensive, why would people even want to have cars if they can barely afford them?

716,1,"Abolishing the electoral college would be the best way to go for everyone. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. source 2, Plumer Some wonder, are the people in the electoral college even reliable? Many also believe that the electoral college is an unfair way of deciding whom the president will be. The electoral college is also flawed in a way that it makes the smaller states feel less important than the bigger states.

Are the people in the electoral college always reliable? Who even knows who chooses our electoral college? Voting citizens can't even control who the electoral college votes for sometimes, this is unjust and an outrage considering us citizens do the moral duty to vote and may not even get a fair outcome anyways. And, there are some cases in which voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. source 2, Plumer This ""winner takes all"" system is a big mess and highly unnecessary. Not to mention, it is also a very unfair way of deciding.

Some question if the electoral college is a fair way of voting. Which it is not. The electoral college can cause an unfair vote to the presidents which also upsets us citizens. What if say, 5,000 people vote in Florida, 3,000 for president 1, and 2,000 for president 2, and the electoral college sends it off as president 1 gets the vote for that college. But then, that 1,000 vote difference could have changed the vote for president country wide. A scenario like this may be unlikely, but it is possible. It has already happened once, it would be a shame if it did again. Chance of a situation like this draws a lot of people away from voting for president. Another unfair scenario was in 1976 when a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. Source 2, Plumer The electoral collage is bound to cause a catastrophe and we should stop it before it does.

The elctoral college is also unfair in a way that smaller states votes do not feel as important. Some people in the smaller states even say they haven't seen a campaign poster throughout an entire election because candidates feel as if campaigning isn't important in places that only have 3 or 4 electoral colleges. If we had a popular vote society, people in smaller states would feel like their vote is as important as those in the bigger states.

Overall, the electoral college is higly unfair way of deciding anything. It should be abolished before it turns into a problem.

534,1,"Voting, one of the most American things I can thing of. This is a democracy, and we have the right to vote for our leader, but not really. There is a thing called the Electoral College, and the electors that you vote for actually vote for the president. Although this does not seem fair, it is a great system. Almost every time your state votes for an Elector, he picks the President that your state wants. So it really is a great deal.

My opponents belive that the president should be voted by popular vote, but i disagree. Richard Posner, writer for slate magazine writes that this method is nondemocratic, and should be overruledsource 3, paragraph 15. Although you are not actually voting for president, you are voting for who votes for president. This method equals out the playing field for states. Insted of all the power going to states like California or Texas. Presidents have to fight for every state. Posner also writes, sometimes the person with the popular vote will not win the election, like in 2000source 3, paragraph 16. Although this was a huge disaster, it was the first time something like this has happened since 1888. Also, 4 years later George Bush won the election again, but for real.

Some may say that America is not filled with the smartest, or brightest people. So you belive that we should hold the fate of who will be president in the hands of an adult who cant spell his own name. Someone ike that has as much power as a guy who has watched every debate, and has done research. So by voting for a democrate elector, your state will vote for a democratic president, if your state votes in a republican elector, then your state will vote for a republican president. It is as simple as that.

The Electoral college provides a point system for every state. the biggest are California with 55, and Texas with 38. The smallest are the dakota, and they each are worth 3 points. The point system is based on population, and how many representatives you have. One of the best parts of this is that every state get attention. Without this system, the candidates would only go to campien at the highest populated states. Then this would cause the smaller states to think that their votes don't matter, and then one day we are going to have a bad guy as our leader.

In conclusion, I belive the Electoral College is a great system, and I hope it lives on. Although it is not really Democratic, it still is a better system than what my oppents belive we should do. This gives us a certantity of oucome, a president that everyone supports, swing states, big states, and helps to avoid runoff elections.

1553,0,"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can greatly benefit society. One major advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. According to the passages, cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure can reach up to 50%. By limiting car usage, we can greatly decrease these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on public health. The passage about Paris implementing a driving ban due to smog highlights the negative consequences of car usage on air quality. The smog in Paris reached levels comparable to that of Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. This can have serious health implications for residents, as polluted air can lead to respiratory problems and other illnesses. By limiting car usage, we can improve air quality and promote better health outcomes for the population.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help improve urban planning and create more sustainable communities. The passage about the German suburb, Vauban, shows how car-free streets and limited parking can create a more accessible and walkable community. This new approach to suburban life is being adopted globally, with the goal of making suburbs more compact and connected to public transportation. By placing stores within walking distance and reducing the dependence on cars, these communities become more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential economic benefits. While there may be initial challenges and resistance, such as lost revenue for delivery companies, the long-term economic effects could be positive. The End of Car Culture passage mentions how car companies like Ford and Mercedes are rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies. This shift in focus indicates a recognition of changing consumer behavior and a greater emphasis on alternative modes of transportation. In addition, the passage mentions that young people are driving less and becoming less interested in car ownership. This trend could have implications for the car industry, as fewer cars are being purchased. However, it also opens up opportunities for other sectors such as public transportation and shared mobility services.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, better urban planning, and potential economic benefits. By adopting smarter planning strategies, promoting alternative transportation options, and creating more walkable communities, we can reap these advantages and create a more sustainable future.",1,"limit car usage have several advantage that can greatly benefit society one major advantage be the reduction of greenhouse gas emission which contribute to climate change accord to the passage car be responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emission in Europe passenger car be responsible for 12 of emission while in some car intensive area in the United States this figure can reach up to 50 by limit car usage we can greatly decrease these emission and mitigate the impact of climate change

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the reasons why it should be maintained as the method for choosing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College offers several important benefits that protect the interests of all Americans.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome. In the event of a dispute over the election results, the Electoral College provides a clear winner by requiring the winning candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes. This system prevents the possibility of prolonged legal battles and instability that could arise if the popular vote were the sole determining factor. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, minimizing the likelihood of disputes.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is everyone's President. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College discourages candidates from solely focusing on the regions with the largest populations. This is crucial for ensuring that the President represents the interests of all Americans and not just those in densely populated areas. As a result, the Electoral College promotes a more balanced and inclusive democracy.

Furthermore, the Electoral College gives smaller states a voice in the election process. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes provides smaller states with a greater say in the outcome of the presidential election. This is especially important because large states already have more influence in Congress due to their greater representation in both the House and the Senate. The Electoral College helps restore some balance to the political power dynamics, ensuring that the concerns and interests of Americans in all states are taken into account.

Additionally, the Electoral College allows for greater focus on swing states. The winner-take-all system incentivizes candidates to campaign and engage with voters in swing states, as these states are often decisive in determining the outcome of the election. This ensures that voters in these states receive more attention from candidates and have a greater opportunity to influence the election. Without the Electoral College, candidates would not have the same motivation to campaign extensively in all states, leading to a potential disenfranchisement of voters in non-swing states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. Unlike a popular vote system, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, thereby avoiding the need for run-off elections. This helps streamline the election process and reduces the likelihood of prolonged uncertainty or political stalemates that could arise from not having a majority winner. The Electoral College provides stability and efficiency in the presidential election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves an important role in maintaining a fair and effective method for choosing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote system, the Electoral College offers unique benefits that protect the interests and voices of all Americans. I urge you to consider these reasons before making any changes to our current election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the perspectives of your constituents when making decisions regarding the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

 lastly the Electoral College eliminate the need for run off election unlike a popular vote system the Electoral College consistently produce a clear winner thereby avoid the need for run off election this help streamline the election process and reduce the likelihood of prolonged uncertainty or political stalemate that could arise from not have a majority winner the Electoral College provide stability and efficiency in the presidential election process 

 in conclusion the Electoral College serve an important role in maintain a fair and effective method for choose the President of the United States while there be valid argument for change to a popular vote system the Electoral College offer unique benefit that protect the interest and voice of all Americans I urge you to consider these reason before make any change to our current election process 

 thank you for your attention to this matter I trust that you will carefully consider the perspective of your constituent when make decision regard the Electoral College

I am writing to you as a concerned citizen of our great state about an issue that directly affects us all, namely the method of choosing the president of the United States. I strongly believe that we should keep the Electoral College, an institution that has served the nation well for over two centuries, despite the criticisms it has faced.

The Electoral College, as Judge Richard A. Posner articulates in ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" is a vital mechanism that allows for the certainty of outcome and ensures a trans-regional appeal by presidential candidates (Posner, 15, 19). A method that provides a decisive victory is not only important for the country's stability but also gives the president-elect a clear mandate (Posner, 18). Its design promotes a sense of inclusivity by requiring candidates to appeal nationwide instead of focusing on specific regions, even though they might heavily favor one candidate over another (Posner, 19).

However, I acknowledge the concerns raised by Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" especially about the system's lack of direct democracy and the potential for 'faithless' electors (Plumer, 9, 11). Yet it's important to note that the founding fathers established the Electoral College precisely as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote (Office of the Federal Register, 1). This compromise continues to serve as an acknowledgement that the United States is a federation of states, not a monolithic entity. 

The argument Plumer presents related to the potential disparity between the popular vote and the election outcome has indeed materialized on a few occasions, but it's important to remember that such instances are rare (Posner, 16). Implementing a direct election system may shine a light on populous states, but it could also alienate less populated ones due to the candidates’ focus on cities and locations with a high concentration of voters (Posner, 21). In such a scenario, several regions of the country might feel underrepresented or overlooked, creating a divide that could be more damaging to the nation's unity.

As the understanding of the electoral process differs among citizens, perhaps a more productive solution than outright abolishment of the Electoral College would be education about this mechanism's significance and operation. This could help minimize the confusion and concerns raised regarding the electoral process whilst preserving the benefits of the current system.

In conclusion, although the Electoral College may not be a perfect system, it has stood the test of time by delivering stable, generally accepted outcomes while maintaining a relative balance of power among states. Therefore, our focus, rather than discarding it, should be to enhance understanding of its workings and purpose.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter, and I look forward to your response.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing today to discuss an important aspect of our electoral process: the Electoral College. As a concerned citizen and advocate for fair and efficient democratic systems, I am of the opinion that we should maintain the Electoral College rather than change to a system of popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. In this letter, I will present arguments in favor of the Electoral College, using information from multiple sources.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is that it ensures certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out in his article, the winner of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, resulting in a clear victory. This is due to the winner-take-all system adopted by most states, where a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. Though a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is theoretically possible, it is highly unlikely. This certainty prevents prolonged disputes over the outcome, as witnessed in the 2000 election. Changing to a system of direct popular vote could invite more disputes and potentially undermine faith in the democratic process.

Another compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, as highlighted by Judge Posner. No region in our diverse nation has enough electoral votes to singlehandedly elect a President. Therefore, candidates are required to campaign across multiple regions and consider the interests of diverse groups of voters. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from assuming office and helps build a sense of national unity. Every region and its unique concerns matter in the Presidential election under the Electoral College system, thereby promoting a more balanced representation of our nation's interests.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, as explained by Plumer. This ensures that voters in swing states receive more attention and information from the candidates, making them more thoughtful voters who are actively engaged in the election process. The influence of swing states in determining the outcome of the election encourages candidates to address the concerns of a broad range of voters. This system discourages candidates from neglecting certain regions or demographics, ensuring that the President is accountable to a wide cross-section of the populace.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores a measure of balance to our political system, particularly for large states. By design, smaller states have a proportionately larger number of electoral votes compared to their population. This balances the influence of larger states, which can lose some weight in the political process due to mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that candidates pay attention to the needs and concerns of citizens across states of varying sizes, creating a more inclusive campaign process.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections, as outlined by Judge Posner. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections can be time-consuming, costly, and potentially divisive. The Electoral College, on the other hand, consistently produces a clear winner by awarding electoral votes based on plurality. This eliminates the need for additional electoral processes and allows for a smooth and efficient transition of power.

While there are valid criticisms of the Electoral College, such as those highlighted by Plumer, it is important to consider the practical reasons for retaining this system. The Electoral College provides certainty, ensures trans-regional appeal, encourages thoughtful voting, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These practical advantages make a strong case for maintaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College continues to serve an essential role in our democratic system. Its benefits outweigh the perceived faults of the system. I urge you to consider the practical reasons for the retention of the Electoral College in any deliberations on electoral reform. Thank you for your time and consideration.

2053,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons For Urban Sustainability

The familiar hum of automobiles, a sound that has become synonymous with urban life, is noticeably absent in certain corners of our world, and for good reason. The carless Suburb of Vauban in Germany illuminates the very possibilities of urban living stripped of automobile dependence. A place where space is utilized for interaction rather than parking, Vauban provides a glimpse into the numerous environmental, social, and health benefits that can be reaped by limiting automobile usage.

Firstly, automobile dependence has been identified as a significant contributor to the global climate crisis. Generating 12% of Europe's greenhouse gas emissions, passenger cars contribute substantially to air pollution and global warming (Rosenthal, 2009). Furthermore, in some automobile-intensive areas of the US, this figure rises to a shocking 50%. Therefore, by reducing car usage, we can significantly lower our carbon footprints, enhancing the health of our planet. The clear air in Vauban is not only a testament to its residents’ commitment but also attests to the more sustainable nature of carless living (Rosenthal, 2009). This is critically relevant in a time of climate crisis where we need to leverage every available opportunity to lower greenhouse emissions and slow down the worsening effects of climate change.

Moreover, limiting car usage has marked effects on reducing air pollution at a local level. The air quality improved dramatically in Paris when a partial driving ban was implemented (Duffer, 2014). Similarly, Bogota’s annual “Day Without Cars” also led to marked reductions in smog (Selsky, 2002). For cities like these, battling with smog and airborne pollutants, limiting car usage could be a potent strategy to achieve healthier air quality and improve citizen health.

Beyond environmental advantages, reducing car usage lends itself to improvements in the quality of urban life. Vauban's pattern of life shows that communities can be more peaceful, cohesive, and active in the absence of cars. In such environments, street interactions are human-centric; children can safely roam on the streets and recreational uses of public spaces become a norm (Rosenthal, 2009). A wider adoption of such ‘low-car’ or ‘car-free’ models in urban planning can lead to healthier, happier and safer communities.

Additionally, car-free lifestyles can foster increased use of sustainable forms of transportation like walking, cycling, and public transit. This could, in turn, supports public health by promoting regular physical activity. An interesting note is the inter-generational shift seen, with younger generations showing less interest in owning and using cars, choosing instead, more sustainable commuting options (Rosenthal, 2013). This reflects a paradigm shift in transportation choices that can be capitalised on by cities to build healthier societies.

In conclusion, limiting car usage not only holds the promise of creating friendlier and more vibrant city spaces, but also significantly helps to lower pollution levels and greenhouse gas emissions. As we strive to make our cities more sustainable and livable, the strategy of reducing car usage should be integral to our urban planning.",1,"title the advantage of limit car usage lesson for Urban Sustainability

77,0,"Cars are a luxury, but others take them for granted. Many people around the world operate cars every single day! Very few people around the world do not own a car, or have never operated one. In Vauban, Germany, residents of an upscale, high class community have decided to give up on cars. vaughn's streets are entirely ""carfree"" except the in the city where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Don't get Germany wrong, you are allowed to own a car, but there's very few places to park the car you own. The only placed you can park are large garages at the end of your neighborhood or development, but parking isn't free here. You must buy a space for 40,000, along with the price of your home. 70 percent of vaughn's citizens do not own cars, and 57 percent alone sold their car to move there. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, Germany completed in 2006, is an excellent example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other places to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning."" According to Elisabeth Rosenthal who wrote, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."" Cars can either be a blessing or a mistake. Cars can tend to put out polluting gases, and endanger our earth. In Paris, all driving was banned due to smog. On a Monday, motorisits with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 fine. The same would apply to the oddnumbered plates the following day. The car emissions were trapped by a warmer layer of air, because of cold nights and warm days. Congestion in Paris, France wa down 60 percent after just fivedays of intensifying snog. This caused the smog to rival Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. That's pretty bad to be competing with China. The Monday where all cars were banned, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates the following day.

Now, what about a car free day? In Bogota, Colombia, there was a car free day. Every citizen either had to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this carfree day. This car free day caused the city to not have any traffic jams, and no accidents at all. This isn't just the first year that Colombia decided to do this, but it was the third! This day is specifically called, ""Day Without Cars."" 7 million citizens were expected to find a different way to go to the destinations they needed to reach, without their trusty cars. Bogota receives a vast amount of rain storms each day, but the turnout was still at large. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Many citizens of Bogota said that this day takes away not only their stress, but also a ton of pollution. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he and his wife rode a twoseat bicycle.

Almost every single citizen in the United States of America owns or drives a car every single day. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed the peak of driving? The United States is known for its broad expanses and suburban ideals, and has long been known for one of the world's prime car cultures. It is indeed the birthplace of Model T the home of Detroit the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally."" Lately America's love addiction with motor vehicles seems to be settling down. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 8 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Most of the explanation to this certainly comes from recession, because broke Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. ""I think that means something more fundamental is going on,"" he also said. All of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession need to find reasons NOT to resume the habit of driving and spending stupid amounts of money on gasoline. The state of New York has a new bikesharing programs and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls refelct those new priorities, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

127,0,"""I'm much happier this way,"" What caused someone to say this? Simply no longer owning a car! Based on how car dependant mostly everyone's life is and how badly most people that don't have a car want one you'd think that going from having one to lacking one must be terrible. Well statistically speaking we might all be moving towards this idea and it might not be such a bad thing!

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Vauban, Germany is home to people that have chosen to give life without cars a shot, many of which love the life style. 70% of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car just to go there. Although this has mostly only been done here many have started slowly adopting the idea. As the author, Elisabeth Rosenthal, of this article pointed out passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse emissions in Europe, and in more car populated areas such as the United States up to 50%. Robert Duffer stated in Paris bans driving due to smog that in Paris Driving had been limited by their government due to extreme levels of pollution and after a short amount of time the ban was called off because the smogpollution had lowered. Just one of the advantages of limiting the usage of cars would be cutting down these huge numbers and getting rid of these issues, and if you asked anyone im pretty sure they'd say that this one advantage is plenty reason already to look into this. Imagine how drastically improved the planet would be if others adopted what Vauban is already doing!

Want a holiday to promote the limiting of cars? Well there actually is one in Bogota, Colombia! Millions of colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to places like work on this day. It already has three years running so far, even if its raining that day, the mayor claims that it doesnt stop people from participating. This day is starting to also branch out to other colombian cities such as Cali and Valledupar, imagine if eventually it becomes an international holiday, the advantages are everywhere. Due to the limiting of car usage there are more people walking on the sidewalks and this has caused the government to improve those sidewalks by making new smooth ones and getting rid of the old cracked ones. More restaurants, parks, sports centers, and even entire shopping centers have been built and opened to the people walking which is a life style improving advantage. If the limiting of cars is done in more places then new things to do and try will open up in that area and in turn prove to be a great advantage from limiting car usage.

Elisabeth Rosenthal has writen about the possibility that in the United States the peak of driving has been reached. As it turns out Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less miles on average, and getting fewer licenses every year that goes by. If such a large population such as the United States is cooling down on car usage why not speed that process up and governments start slowly but efficiently reducing car usage internationally? This would mean that in public transport there would be more socializing because the people that take that same bus everyday at 7:00 AM along with you would become your friends or at least aquaintances. So when you think about it friendships might even come with car limiting as well!

From the reduction of polution to the improvements of everyday life style to even possibly socializing with new people, the possibilities of car usage limiting are endless.",0,"I be much happy this way what cause someone to say this simply no long own a car base on how car dependant mostly everyone 's life be and how badly most people that do n't have a car want one you would think that go from have one to lack one must be terrible well statistically speak we might all be move towards this idea and it might not be such a bad thing

364,1,"A huge percentage of Americans want the Electoral College abolished. Their views are justified when the Electoral College fails to reflect the population's opinion. Does it make sense to base our Democracy on this downtrodden way of electing the president? The Electoral College should be abolished for not reflecting the public view,having the chance of making an electors with no interests for those who elected him,and giving equal power to a state with a lower population to the same as a high one. Although the college guarantees a victor the other reasons outweight it in comparison.

First of all,the Electoral College should be abolished for failing to represent the population majority. When an American goes to vote it's ""not for the president,but for a slate of electorss,who in turn elect the president.""10 Upon seeing the results with the popular vote cast aside by the electors and voting something else entirely how could an average American feel anything else then betrayed? It's due to this that many Americans don't even consider going to vote feeling as if it is a waste of time due to the electors deciding for them. Going to vote for our president should be what represents America seeing as Americans always talk and brag about the amount of freedom we have. Instead it's more of ""who's the electors going to vote for this election""?

In addition, the electorss chosen are not even required to vote for who their state has approved of. Giving this power to the electors could possibly make them corrupt and go against the population. An example would be Republicans sending a Republican electors but the electors instead votes for the oppsosite party. It doesn't happen very often but making it even a possibility is a huge risk to the population of that state and could easily incite unrest among the population. It's very possible and the electorss""could always defy the will of the people.""11 Letting someone have that kind of power goes against the very principals of our democracy and should be erraticated.

Finally,the college is not equal when it somes to states and population. When a tie would happen the representatives from smaller states become equal to the bigger states such as Texas. Basically with this equal voting power ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.""12 This could go as far as the minority getting the president they want and most of the country's people being dissatisfied,this could lead to a catastrophe not seen by America throughout its existence. It also seems irrational that a state with fifteen times less of a population would still have the same power as the bigger state.

To conclude,the Electoral College fails in many places where an attempt at Democracy is made. It doesn't even represent Democracy when the voting that matters is made from a select group of individuals instead of the population itself. These individuals are not even required to oblige to the majority of the state making voting at the poll seem useless. Where the college does give equal power it is misplaced by giving minorities a chance of overruling the majority. No doubt this ""Electoral College"" should be abolished.",0,"a huge percentage of Americans want the Electoral College abolish their view be justify when the Electoral College fail to reflect the population 's opinion do it make sense to base our Democracy on this downtrodden way of elect the president the Electoral College should be abolish for not reflect the public view have the chance of make an elector with no interest for those who elect he and give equal power to a state with a low population to the same as a high one although the college guarantee a victor the other reason outweight it in comparison

653,0,"global warming has been said to be a problem for years now. it has been said that we are slowly but surely destroying our ozone layers. and air pollution is for sure one of the main causes. Smog levels have risen substantially and it shows, but there are more and more solutions that are beginning to show.

germany definitely has the right approach here. they live in what is pretty much a car free society. in a one square mile city of 5500 people, 70% of them do not have cars. everything in that city is within walking or biking distance so there is no need for one. having a society like this is also very stress relieving in a sense. you no longer have the every day stress of being on a highway or constantly alert for cars, a society like this is for the most part more laid back then a regular one. the amount of exercise is also increased here because you are walking or biking everywhere, you are constantly moving. it is something that every country should take into consideration. the long term effects of pollution will be detrimental to our world and we know that. now is our time to fix that.

tail pipe emission accounts for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50% in dense cities in the United States. and after near record breaking pollution in just a matter of days, paris decided to put a partial ban on driving. by doing this congestion in the city was down 60%, and by doing this the smog cleared relatively quickly. in this short amount of time that driving was partially banned we were able to see a large decrease in not only pollution but the amount of congestion in a city. not only does this make everyday life safer for every day citizens but improves the living quality of all people by making the air and world cleaner. projects like this are showing multiple benefits and great long term affects, not only for car drivers but for pedestrians that are walking the streets to, if congestion in a busy city is down by that much it makes getting around a lot easier for someone who walksbikesor runs everywhere. i think its crucial for people to understand the upsides to having societies like this. grnated it will be hard to adjust to but the upsides to it will outweigh the cons in the long run.

a big thing to look at here in one of the benefits of having a car free society like this is not just the pollution but the exercise rate. as americans we are without a doubt an overweight country and thats obvious. what having something like this would do for us is incredible. even if it was a one day thing to try like Bogota, Colombia. once a year everyday they have what is called a ""car free day"" where everyone in the city is restricted from using cars unless it is a taxi or transit. this now enforces or allows if you will, everyone to ride a bike, skate, run, or walk to their destination. the streets are left practically empty. when you also do this you can bring improvements to your community. Bogota went from a cracked unevenly paved sidewalk to the replacement of smooth broad and even sidewalks. parks and sport centers have increased and blossomed all throughout the city, and you see the community just start to come together as a whole.

Now with all this being said there obviously are still downsides to cutting out gas producing cars. weather being a main one. suppose it rains one day, how do you get to work? not only that but in warmer climates if you have to go a longer distance to get to your job it gets hot and if you are in your suit and tie you're going to be sweating. if you are a blue collar worker, you have equipment that you have to keep on you at all times not having a vehicle will restrict that. not being able to drive will also slow down many buisnesses that travel to someones home such as a lawn service or a plumber. if you work out of town how do you get to your job? people would have to leave their families and move closer to their workplace if they worked out of town or quit their job. there is a lot to take into consideration when you think about all the possibilities of creating a society like this. and the only way this could work is if it was incorporated the same way that it was for Vauban germany. if you had a one square mile society where everything was walking distance and your job was in the area then i believe it would be extremely beneficial, but areas like that are few and far between and making areas like that would change the geography of the entire country.

by no means are we as a country America ready to change to this kind of society any time soon, but i do think that in due time we can benefit from this in a huge way. but there is a lot that has to change and our nation as a whole has to be willing to conform to this. there would be a substancial amount of change in this nation if this were to happen and we as a country are not one that necessarily likes change. we like our two car white pickett fence houses and cutting that out of everyones lives would no go over well with the majority of Americans. this is something that the future of America needs to seriously take into consideration. its appearant that we are destroying our world every single day and we are one of the main contributors.",0,"global warming have be say to be a problem for year now it have be say that we be slowly but surely destroy our ozone layer and air pollution be for sure one of the main cause Smog level have rise substantially and it show but there be more and more solution that be begin to show

1493,0,"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing the reliance on cars, people can experience improved physical and mental well-being, reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and increased accessibility and efficiency in transportation.

One of the major benefits of limiting car usage is the improvement in individuals' health and well-being. As the passage from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" states, residents of car-free communities report feeling happier and less stressed. Without the constant need to navigate through traffic and find parking spaces, people have more time for physical activities like walking or biking. This leads to a more active lifestyle and better overall health.

Moreover, limiting car usage can significantly reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. As the passage explains, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can mitigate the negative impacts of emissions on climate change and air quality. Car-free communities, like Vauban in Germany, serve as examples of how this can be achieved. These communities prioritize public transportation and walkability, making it easier for residents to rely on alternative modes of transportation and reduce their carbon footprint.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve accessibility and efficiency in transportation. As seen in the passage about Bogota's car-free day, banning cars for a day can significantly reduce traffic congestion and promote the use of alternative transportation options like buses and bicycles. This can lead to more efficient and reliable public transportation systems, making it easier for people to get around without relying on cars. Moreover, car-free communities often prioritize mixed-use development and place stores within walking distance, reducing the need for lengthy car trips to run errands.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing the reliance on cars, people can experience improved physical and mental well-being, reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and increased accessibility and efficiency in transportation. Implementing measures like car-free days, car-free communities, and promoting alternative modes of transportation can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future.",1,"limit car usage can have numerous advantage for individual and community by reduce the reliance on car people can experience improve physical and mental well being reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emission and increase accessibility and efficiency in transportation

595,1,"As a citizen of the United States, I have the right to have my poinion on the Electoral College, and my opinion is that we should not have an Electoral College because of many reasons. The reasons include the following if American citizens vote for a slate of electors that then vote for the president, we technically aren't even voting ourselves. Also, the electors that we vote for to elect our president don't always have to vote for the president we want, but it could also be in a case as if who they wanted to vote for. Lastly, the population of states affects the amount of votes casted off into the possible president's election.

In the Electoral College process, we, the U.S. citizens, vote for a group of electors who then vote for the President of the United States. According to The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the BestLaid Defenses of the System are Wrong , ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president Paragraph 10."" Based on what the information that the paragraph is giving us, the citizens of the U.S. technically are not even having a say in who the president is, America uses the quote ""It's a free country"", but really, you're not even letting the people have a say in who the next president is...

Based on what I stated in the second paragraph, whoever we vote to be our electors of the voting for the U.S. president, don't always have to vote for who the citizens want as president, but what they, the members of the congress want. ""Who are the electors? They can be anyanyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Paragraph 10."" It doesn't matter who is voting, what does matter is that they all have different oppinions on who would do better if president. These electors chosen to vote are basically allowed to vote on whoever they agree is right, your vote is invalid to their poinion, it' who they want. And is that fair? No.

Another reason I do not think the electoral college is right is because the population of states affects the amount of votes casted off into the possible president's election. For example, according to paragraph 12 of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the BestLaid Defenses of the System are Wrong , it says ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single represenative from Whyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as 55 represenatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" What this is trying to say, is that it doesn't even matter about how many voters there are, but about how man represenatives there are. This leads me back to my point of where we really have no say in who is president or not.

In the electoral college, In the Electoral College process, we, the U.S. citizens, vote for a group of electors who then vote for the President of the United States, but that doesn't always mean we get what we want when it comes to voting.

556,0,"""All of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" Said David Goldberg. Nowadays Cars are our main Source when it comes to transportation.

Limiting your car usage should absolutely be more important in todays society. It's plenty of things going on around us that most are unaware about, And limiting your car usage can be one thing to start helping to prevent these issues. Most cars give off alot of Pollution in the cities you live in an that effects animals. For example: The oil spill was a major problem in the ocean and that killed alot of animals an Demolished most of the sea life environmental foodchains. The capital of France had an intensifying amount of smog, but car traffic tended to decreased 60% after 5 days. Beijing China was known as the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel Fuel was the blame. You could even try those cars that dont require gas so the cities could be less polluted, But theres disadvantages to those cars as well.

At one point of time gas prices were sky high and people weren't really satisfied with it. Now Gas prices have decreased an people are even more satisfied an happy to get gas. Saving up on gas would help out alot to in todays world as well. How? Because Everything in life has a Big Fat Price tag on it so to help save up to get better things or things you need you can probably go for not paying for Gas as much. Everyday around 5:00 or 5:30 there's something called 5:00 traffic. When everyone is just about getting off work, headed to night school, going to the store, or whatever the case may be. This is the craziest time of the day to drive an your just ready to get home an dont feel like dealing with traffic.... you can take the City bus, Subway, or maybe even walk if its not far. Some people may call you crazy but it reduces the amount of money being spent on gas. its only maybe like 10cents to ride the city bus i believe...But the point is your saving money. Then by the time you finally decide ""Oh i would like to drive my car"" your tank would be full cause you havent been driving it so you wouldnt have to stop for gas. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting "" Car Reduced"" Communities, and Legislators are starting to act. Many Experts expect public transportation to play a Larger Role in a new 6 year federal transportation bill approved this year, Said Mr. Goldberg. Walking isnt always quite bad. Look on the bright side your Burning Calories, shedding pounds, and if you run your building you Endurance. Instead of having to drive to a gym far away walk to a nearest one an have a pre workout by jogging or running there. Same thing applies to Bicycling.

Nowadays since majority of the United States own cars Traffic is horrible at certain hours of the day. Most people are too impatient for the wait or become aggressive drivers which is most likely to cause accidents. Maybe your ready to get home after a horrible day or your really tired from work an you realize your about to run into 5:00 Traffic an it'll be forever until you finally get home. If taking the City Buses or subways you won't have to deal with all that pressure. On a City bus you can just have a seat chit chat with other people as they hop on or just relax until you get to your destination. If your really tired you could just tell someone to wake you up when its time to. At least it'll be better then you being behind the wheel. If your workplace is Walking or Bicycling distance then you should feel even better to just scroll past all the people having to deal with the traffic. ""Its a Good opportunity to take away stress and Lower Air pollution"" Said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat Bicycle with his wife.

Fellow Citizens should understand the Advantages of limiting their car usage because of the Pollution, To Save up on gas, and Less stress to deal with Traffic. Maybe one day cities would take more action an save up on gas for these reasons.",0,"all of our development since world war II have be center on the car and that will have to change say David Goldberg nowadays car be our main source when it come to transportation

832,0,"Millions of people around the world use cars, trucks, or any means of transportation, although some cities have started to limit or even ban their car usage. This has both made people happy and others were angered. Even so limiting car usage is actually beneficial in many ways.

Limiting car usage is a beneficial idea because it benefits with the environment. Cars have been known for polluting the skies and the very air that we breathe. As a matter of fact ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars"" source 1. This means that if this magnitude of greenhouse gases are being emitted by passenger cars alone then the air will be polluted and animals plants and other organisms will die. Additional evidence supports the fact that car limitation is a beneficial act to society. According to Source 3 by Andrew Selsky, the people of Bogota Columbia have been satisfied with the limitations of car usage in the city, the article states that ""it's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution""source 3. This means that in the limiting the idea of car usage we can decrease the pollutants that poison may living things around the world.

Another advantage in limiting the amount of car usage is that it lowers traffic. Many of todays roads are conjested by thousands of people using the road for their own purposes in shrinking the level of cars being used we can shrink that by a large amount. This is supported by Source 2, written by Robert Duffer, in this article he explains that cars, trucks, etc. are the cause of much congestion and pollution. This contributes to why Paris decided to pass a partial driving ban in Paris. According to this source since the ban car congestion went down by 60 percent source 2. This means that the streets are now safer and clearer in the area. Other sources state that car bans in Bogota Columbia have lead the residents of that city to find other means of transportation to devoid traffic source 3. This means that if cars are limited then traffic will decrease.

A benefactor in limiting car usage isit eliminates stress. Car infested areas have meant tons of stress. By limiting the cause of the problem then you eliminate the problem itself. According to Source 1 people in the outskirts of Germany have become more relaxed in life since cars have been banned. ""I feel less tence"" one of the people the author interviewed said. This key evidence means that if cars are limited then people can live a relaxed worry free life.

 another advantage in limit the amount of car usage be that it lower traffic many of today road be conjeste by thousand of people use the road for their own purpose in shrink the level of car be use we can shrink that by a large amount this be support by source 2 write by Robert Duffer in this article he explain that car truck etc be the cause of much congestion and pollution this contribute to why Paris decide to pass a partial driving ban in Paris accord to this source since the ban car congestion go down by 60 percent source 2 this mean that the street be now safe and clear in the area other source state that car ban in Bogota Columbia have lead the resident of that city to find other mean of transportation to devoid traffic source 3 this mean that if car be limit then traffic will decrease

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the debate on whether to keep the Electoral College or change to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States. After careful consideration and analyzing information from various sources, I believe that it is essential to retain the Electoral College for the following reasons:

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in the election process. As highlighted in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes arising from close elections since the winner-takes-all system in most states creates a landslide victory for the winning candidate in the electoral vote count.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" Under this system, a candidate must possess trans-regional appeal instead of relying solely on regional support. This requirement compels candidates to campaign across different regions of the country to secure victory. As Judge Posner argues, this is crucial for successful governance, as a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to effectively represent and address the concerns of citizens from all regions.

Additionally, the Electoral College places emphasis on swing states. By focusing campaign efforts on these states, candidates are compelled to address the specific issues faced by these regions. This ensures that swing state voters receive greater attention from candidates, enhancing the electoral process's representativeness. As stated by Judge Posner, swing state voters tend to be more informed and thoughtful voters, and allowing them to decide the election can lead to more meaningful outcomes.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large and small states. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states lose weight in the political balance. However, the Electoral College counteracts this imbalance by allocating electoral votes based on population size. This ensures that presidential candidates pay equal attention to the concerns of both small and large states, preventing larger states from dominating the political discourse.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate secures a majority of the popular votes. This eliminates the complications and costs associated with organizing additional elections and ensures a clear winner. As Judge Posner elucidates, pressure for run-off elections is reduced by the Electoral College system, thereby streamlining the presidential election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, the voter turnout in recent elections suggests otherwise. About half of the eligible American population participated in the 2012 election, demonstrating that voters are motivated by their desire to express a political preference rather than believing that their individual votes may single-handedly change the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial component of our democratic system. It provides certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, ensures focus on swing states, restores balance between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is evident that the Electoral College's advantages outweigh the arguments for a popular vote system. Consequently, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of our presidential elections.

Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter. I trust that you will make the best decision for the benefit of our nation and its citizens. I look forward to seeing your continued commitment to our democracy.

404,0,"Imagine the world in the future, completely full and covered with cars. Roads are going to start taking up every area of Earth, if people continue driving everywhere and buying cars. I think people should limit car usage because it's environmental friendly, they'll get more exercise, and people will be happier. Cars can be handy from time to time, but i think they should only be used occasionally. Imagine if there was a car for everyone on the planet. Car usage should decrease.

First of all, the Earth is beautiful and the people on it need to take better care of it. For example, just one day without the use of cars in a city, allowed them to construct bike paths, new sidewalks, and reduced traffic jams. Fuel from cars will polute the air and cause smog. If everyone continues to use cars as much as they do or more, there will be no way to clean all the air. When Paris banned cars for a while, smog was cleared and reduced by a lot. Limiting car use will not save the Earth completely, but it will help very much.

Secondly, if people started using cars less, they could get outside more and get more exercise. Biking will help people get fresh air and decrease pollution because cars won't be used as much. People should start finding jobs or doing activities that are close enough to walk or bike to. Cars are for situations in which you really have no other way there or long distances. That's all I think they should be used for. Everyone would be much more fit and healthy if it weren't for being lazy and having to take a car there.

Lastly, not using cars could increase people's happiness. Some people suggest that having a car makes them tense. Everyone would become much closer together and explore more of the world without cars. We could all be outdoors or around each other more. For example, you could take the bus to work instead of your car and meet a new friend. You never know what could happen when you try something new. It's good to change things up once in a while, like not taking your car every now and then and finding another way there.

In conclusion, the positives definetely outnumber the negatives of limiting car use. The main three reasons in my opinion is that it's environmental friendly, you'll get more exercise, and you'll most likely be much happier. Think about all the good outcomes that could come out of not driving your car and try it sometime.",0,"imagine the world in the future completely full and cover with car road be go to start take up every area of Earth if people continue drive everywhere and buy car I think people should limit car usage because it be environmental friendly they 'll get more exercise and people will be happy car can be handy from time to time but I think they should only be use occasionally imagine if there be a car for everyone on the planet car usage should decrease

1648,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage brings a multitude of advantages to society and the environment. As demonstrated in the passage set, there are many benefits to reducing our reliance on cars and finding alternative modes of transportation. 

One significant advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the New York Times, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some areas of the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere, mitigating the effects of climate change.

Additionally, reducing car usage can lead to improved air quality. In the passage about Paris, it is mentioned that a partial driving ban was enforced due to intense smog. The article explains that cold nights and warm days caused car emissions to get trapped in the air. By limiting the number of cars on the road, we can prevent this accumulation of pollutants and improve the overall air quality in cities.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier modes of transportation. The passage about Bogota highlights the success of a car-free day where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. Encouraging people to walk, bike, or use public transportation not only reduces congestion on the roads but also promotes physical activity, leading to healthier citizens.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The passage about Vauban, Germany, describes how the suburb is designed without street parking, driveways, or home garages, encouraging residents to rely on public transportation. This type of smart planning not only reduces the need for large parking lots but also encourages the development of walkable neighborhoods with stores and amenities within walking distance. This creates vibrant communities where people can easily access what they need without relying on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage brings numerous advantages to society and the environment. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, promotes healthier modes of transportation, and leads to more compact and accessible communities. By embracing alternative transportation options and rethinking our reliance on cars, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

1097,1,"Dear State Senator , I wrote this letter to you to talk about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. My opinion on this intriguing subject is that we should keep the Electoral college , my reasons being that voting by a popular vote can sometimes go wrong and we avoid the RunOff Elections. When its time to pick a new president very few people research about this president and his slate of electors , they just vote for the most appalling to them , the one that is always out and doing meetings, or brunches , or just having a perfect day with their family. People that research or dig deep to find out who they are really voting for.

Let me start by saying that the ones whom created the Electoral College , where our founding fathers , these men are thought as wise and caring for their country. The reason stated why the Electoral College should be kept because popular voting can go wrong. Yes the popular vote of the Electoral College its worth but maybe not that much. In Defense of the Electoral College : Five reasons to keep our depised method of choosing the President , it states that "" But each party...win the national popular vote""source 3. Posner is stating that each party picks their electors to be trustworthy , not someone who would do dirty work behind their backs. People go out and vote for our next president and see them running our country , but sometimes people vote for a president for the reasons being that they just want to vote. Its not like the lines outside are not long enough for a person to just go into the voting booth and pick a random president and just leave. People dont actually look behind, search for whom they are voting for.Thats why the Electoral College shouldn be ruled out , the Electoral College is actually helping out more then we thought. When we least expect it we have a crazy wako running our country , then that would be the time when the people would Notice that they made a huge mistake.

RunOff elections , sounds like a tedious process. When RunOff elections occur some people get annoyed , why its a longer process. We get a little bit delayed on finding out on whom the president of the United States is going to be. People want to know who going to be the next president of their country , whos going to try to fix the small little problems the last president left. THose are mainly alll the questions these voters ask. In The Indefensible Electoral College :Why Even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford states "" At the most basic level...in the ""swing"" states"" source 2. Bradford claims that the candidates dont spend much time in states that they know wont get plenty of votes. Well true but why would they both of theses candidates are running for president they need to get as many votes they can if they are bad or good. Even though we are technically not being fair with theses states why because the candidiates arent paying so much of the their attention and aren't caring for those states votes. This country runs off on what the people want but sometimes are the people being fair?.

Keeping the Electoral College can be a really good thing do to the fact there are people that do know about choosing a president.It's been stated before that some people dont care at all who the next president is, as lonmg as they fix their problems and they have jobs, and good medicare they are perfectly fine who the president is. The Electoral College is like a helping hand.",0,"dear State Senator I write this letter to you to talk about keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States my opinion on this intriguing subject be that we should keep the Electoral college my reason be that voting by a popular vote can sometimes go wrong and we avoid the RunOff Elections when its time to pick a new president very few people research about this president and his slate of elector they just vote for the most appalling to they the one that be always out and do meeting or brunch or just have a perfect day with their family People that research or dig deep to find out who they be really vote for

340,1,"Dear senatoor of Florida. I am here tooday too toell you whato I tohink abouto tohe Electooral College. I tohink tohe tohe Electooral College is a very irratoional way too electo our presidentos of tohe untoied stoatoes of America. Ito mighto have been effectoive when ito was firsto creatoed, buto now ito docento seem like ito can work outo anymore. Leto me toell you why.

Well for stoartoers, under tohe Electooral College systoem, votoers votoe noto for tohe presidento, buto votoe for a slatoe of electoors, who in tourn electo tohe presidento. This was stoatoed by Bradford plumer in his artoicle : The indefensible Electooral collegee: why even tohe bestolaid defenses of tohe systoem are wrong. This is noto fair too tohe citoizens. They should be alowed too votoe for whatoever presidento tohey wanto, instoead of letotoing a bunch of electoors ""pledged"" too tohe candidatoes votoe for tohem.

Plumer also writoes : ""Can votoers contorol whom toheir electoors votoe for? Noto always."" Whato does tohis mean?

If ito was such a greato systoem, why canto citoizens always have contorol over who toheir electoors votoe for?

Plumer decides too writoe: ""Do votoers sometoimes geto confused abouto tohe electoors and votoe for tohe wrong candidatoe? Sometoimes."" This is why tohe Electooral College needs too be abolished.

1262,0,"Limiting car use causes pollution, increases costs to users regardless of where services or services are offered. Furthermore, over use of the gas results in increased environmental degradation, harming our resources while damaging our environment.

When consumers pay a larger amount before gasoline is refined then there are higher costs of running the engine than otherwise. There are fewer places where the gas can be purchased locally causing more problems. Car trips will usually have higher tolls which results in lost wages for the transportation worker, who goes to an unnecessary location for work and then returns home and gets to pay back his transportation back costs. The car accident rate amongst children also has increased. Car pollution can become airborne easily, contaminating children's health. Also children tend to be more careless and more often in accidents simply because of being pushed out of their cars onto the road. All of this can be done to better an already polluted Earth that is becoming increasingly damaged at a much faster rate. Limiting our vehicle use helps our citizens with a reduced budget. It also reduces pollution for local areas. Furthermore, it improves public health and makes city dwellers a wealthier society.

Limiting our own usage by adopting public transportation, walking, biking, and public transport actually would be beneficial for the citizens and planet. I think its very healthy but very little others show similar sentiment mostly environmental activists who want a more environmentally clean place so it often is still looked down upon it still will bring about a very drastic price eventually but there will never be carbon credit trading or an oil recycling scheme unless people want it too.

762,1,"I believe we the people should be able to vote for who we want for president. We have always been told we have a freedom of speech, yet we cannot truly vote for who we want for president. The votes are all taken and used to see who is more popular with the people. But who decided who gets to be president is not us. It is the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a group of people in each state who decide the president for us. I think everyone should get to vote on who they want as president, and i think it should actually count. The Electoral College is unfair and I believe popular vote should decide who we get as the president of the nation that we have or rights to vote in.

In the words of Bob Dole ""Abolish the electoral college."" It is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It is unfair because of the winnertakesall system there is in each state. With this in place the candidates take no time in the states they know they have not of chance of winning in. Instead they spend all of their time in states they may have a tight race in. for example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see the candidates at all. Twentyfive of the largest media markets did not even get to see a single campaign ad. Under the Electoral College system they do not vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who then turn around and vote for the president they want. Is that really fair. That we are putting our nations future in the hands of only 538 people.

Popular votes should be what decides our president. Therefore we actually have a say in who we want to be president. For example, in the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes then George W. Bush nationwide, but because of the Electoral College Bush won because he had 271 electoral votes while Gore had 266. Also in the election in2012 Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes comparing to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. Sure he still would have won but at least individual people actually had a say in who they got as their president. Also in 2012, the popular vote was very close in Florida, but Obama won the electoral vote with 29. But in Wyoming the same thing happened and he only got three electoral votes. This shows a large state gets more attention in presidential candidates than a small state does. If presidency was decided by the individual votes then it wouold be more fair and more poeple would have a say in it.

If this country really gave us the right to vote then we would really have a say in who we want as our president. But the Electoral College is not letting us do that. Only two states do something a little differently, but it still does not make that much of a difference. If we had more of a say in our presidency i believe we would be a better nation more people would actually vote cause there would be a better chance of them actually having a say in what they want for this nation.",0,"I believe we the people should be able to vote for who we want for president we have always be tell we have a freedom of speech yet we can not truly vote for who we want for president the vote be all take and use to see who be more popular with the people but who decide who get to be president be not we it be the Electoral College the Electoral College be a group of people in each state who decide the president for we I think everyone should get to vote on who they want as president and I think it should actually count the Electoral College be unfair and I believe popular vote should decide who we get as the president of the nation that we have or right to vote in

103,1,"Dear Senator, The Electoral College was created many, many years ago in the Constitution by our founding fathers, and now it is finally its time to retire. The Electoral College should be taken away and replaced by election by popular vote, in order to determine the president of the United States. The Electoral college should be abolished, because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are not treated fairly in this process. The United States strives to be a place of freedom and equality, but we as a country can not achieve this goals with this process in place.

The United States of America, is all about people protecting their rights, but how can that be if citizens are not even allowed to represent themselves with their own votes. According to the Office of the Federal Register's article,""What is the Electoral College?,""you help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" Which means that our votes just choose people to represent our state and vote for us. So whats the whole point of voting in the first place? Is it just to make citizens feel like they are actually choosing the president. This process would not be a problem if the electors actually represented us correctly. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumer, ""in 2000...Al Gore... won the popular vote but lost the presidency,"" because of the electoral college. Plumer went on to quote a Gallop poll recorded after Al Gore lost which reported,"" over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to kind we have now."" Thats over half of the people voting! But the incident with Al Gore was not the only one, also according to Bradford Plumer's article,"" in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" In other words, they were trying to cheat and make sure the out come of the vote was what they wanted. People may argue that there have only been few instances of the Electoral College making mistakes, but how many more mistakes are they going to make in the future. Will there be so many, that our entire political system becomes corrupt. The citizens of the United States should be allowed to represent themselves with their own vote, and choose their own leaders.

How can the U.S. strive for equality, if states are not treated fairly through the process of the electoral college? The Electoral College process, is a winnertakesall system, because of this, candidates spend their time only focused on specific states. States that are most populated, or that they think will be a ""swing"" state, basically any state that has a specific insterest to them and that will help their campaign. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" written by Bradford Plumer,""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This is a result of the faulty system, how are people suppossed to know who they want to vote for, if candidates won't even take the time to make a pitch to them? If the United States really wants equality, they need to start by having a equal state voting process.

At the end of it all, the Electoral College should be abolished because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are treated unfairly in the process. Help the United States continue to reach its goal of freedom and equality by abolishing the Electoral College.

1700,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Living in a society that heavily relies on cars for transportation has its drawbacks. However, there are several advantages to limiting car usage that can benefit individuals and the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can alleviate issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, congestion, and pollution, while also promoting healthier and more sustainable forms of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is a significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to air pollution and global warming. According to a study, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can make substantial progress in tackling this issue.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can alleviate traffic congestion in urban areas. In cities like Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced due to smog, the congestion reduced by 60 percent (Duffer). This decrease in traffic not only reduces travel time for individuals, but it also contributes to a more efficient and productive transportation system overall.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. The smog and pollution caused by car emissions have detrimental effects on human health. By adopting car-free initiatives like the one implemented in Bogota, where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, or took public transportation instead of driving, we can reduce air pollution and create a healthier living environment (Selsky). This can lead to a decrease in respiratory diseases and other health problems caused by poor air quality.

Limiting car usage also promotes the use of alternative and sustainable forms of transportation. In some car-reduced communities, stores and amenities are placed within walking distance or easily accessible by public transportation (Rosenthal). This encourages individuals to rely less on cars and instead use modes of transportation that are better for their health and the environment. Walking, biking, and taking public transportation have numerous benefits, including increased physical activity, less fuel consumption, and reduced traffic congestion.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, improve air quality, and promote healthier and more sustainable forms of transportation. It is crucial for individuals and communities to embrace these initiatives to create a greener and more livable future for all.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

1121,1,"The Electoral College is a system that must be changed. It is a system that takes away the people's vote in a sense. As it originated from the Founding Fathers, it is as well an outdated system, that could have a drastic overhaul. The Electoral College could be thought of as ruining portions of this democracy, granting the people to vote for a president. There could be great error introduced to such a way of selecting people for such positions. Therefore, I stand vehemently on the side that the Electoral College must change, granting the people and the government a cleaner, more reliable form of election by three contentions: it removes the thought of there being an improper ratio of electoral votes to popular votes it is too easy for fraud to occur in the system and because of how irrational and unfair it is.

The first reason why the Electoral College must be changed in favor of a popular vote system is because of how there is such a margin of error introduced in its existence. The opposition may argue that a popular voting system may have equal, if not a greater chance of error, but that is very inaccurate. In a popular voting scenario, things are about as basic as possible. Election results are taken directly from the people of each state, and the results are then combined and compared, in turn selecting someone into office. In contrast, the Electoral College is far more complicated, resulting in more things to go wrong. For instance, a notable example is the 2000 election between Gore and Bush. In this scenario, Gore received a larger number of popular votes, as Bush won the Electoral College. The whole practice of the Electoral College introduces so many variables to the equation, that it would just be very irrational to use such a system.

Continuing, the next reason why the popular voting system should replace the Electoral College is by the chance of ""fraud"" in such a form of election. The members of the Electoral College could be anyone. Now, this may not be thought of as fraud, however it could as well be thought of as fraud of the system. These members of the College could potentially curve the results of an election. For instance, in the 2000 election, members did not stay true to the one candidate, resulting in the possibility for in improper ratio of votes between the Electoral College and the populous. A counter of this argument may be how often this sort of thing may occur. The 2000 election was the first election since 1888 that had a similar problem. However, this sort of thing should never occur. There should never be an occasion of a problem occuring in something as substantial as a presidential election.

My final contention is regarding how irrational and unfair the entire Electoral College is. In this, there is a type of winnertakeall system set in place. This means that, in most states, if a candidate wins the state, they take the Electoral College for the state. Because of this, candidates mainly focus on campaigning in states that they have a clear chance of winning. This is extremely unfair for many voters in the states that these candidates do not even visit. They would have no evidence of what to vote on in election. This could also change an election, with disastrous results. For example, in the 1976 election, a mere few thousand different votes in both Ohio and Hawaii could have led to a tie in the election. Ties are often fatal in the Electoral College system, as delegations in Congress determine a winner of the election. A counter to this claim may be how the winnertakesall system encourages more campaigning in the tossup states, where close attention is set upon the campaigning individuals. However, this still does not change the fact that other states are not receiving the proper amount of campaigning to prove a fair election.

In summation, the Electoral College must be changed in favor of a popular vote form of election by three previously stated contentions. First, it provides the chance for there to be disastrous results in an election. These results may consist of there being a tie, or an improper ratio of popular votes to electoral votes, as seen in the 2000 election. To continue, my second contention is regarding how there is a chance of corruptness and disagreement in an election. With the Electoral College in place, anybody could technically become part of the College, and there may be a dispute between what member is for what candidate and such. This could be very confusing for the voters. And finally, the entire system of the Electoral College is plainly unfair and irrational. This results in the election being unfair to certain states that did not receive proper campaigning for particular candidates, as it allows candidates to choose which states they would like to take part in campaigning with. In all, the Electoral College is a jumbled, confusing mess of election and governmentation.",0,"the Electoral College be a system that must be change it be a system that take away the people 's vote in a sense as it originate from the Founding Fathers it be as well an outdated system that could have a drastic overhaul the Electoral College could be think of as ruin portion of this democracy grant the people to vote for a president there could be great error introduce to such a way of select people for such position therefore I stand vehemently on the side that the Electoral College must change grant the people and the government a clean more reliable form of election by three contention it remove the thought of there be an improper ratio of electoral vote to popular vote it be too easy for fraud to occur in the system and because of how irrational and unfair it be

395,1,"We need to keep the Electoral College because it keeps the elections fair. It keeps them fair by allowing the states to be proportionaly represented. Also it makes sure there will not be runoff elections and keeps the presidential candidates from favoring one region.

The Electoral College keeps the election fair because all states are represented proportianly to the population of the state. This allows for the smaller states to have a more impactful vote on the president. Since each state is represented equally the election is more fair than if just a popular vote was taken. This system is called unfair by some because they think that their vote is not being heard. This is not true because in source one it says that when you are voting for a president, you are actually voting for who your electors are going to vote for. So if you vote say democratic, thats a vote going toward the elector voting democratic in turn him or her voting democratic for the president.

If the president was elected by a popular vote, there is a risk of runoff elections as shown in case three when nixon had 43 percent of the popular vote but won the Electoral College allowing for a fair winner to be elected. If we continue to use the Electoral College a clear winner will always be produces, but if we go by popular vote a runoff election can occur. Some people may say that the Electoral College is unfair because the winner of the popular vote may not win because of the Electoral College vote and that is not true. If the president was elected by popular vote he or she who is running can just go for the big states, win them over and all smaller states are left with no significant say in the election.

If the Electoral College was not used it would allow presidential candidates to favor different regions making it seem like he or she was just the souths president or the norths ect. So with the Electoral College it makes the candidates branch out to try and win more states that they usually would not try to appeal to. In source two the speaker says ""The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance winning. This statement is not true because the Electoral College forces the candidates to branch out to get more votes. And if the runner knows he or she won't win that state why spend money and other resources on a regardless cause.

When all is considered about keeping the Electoral College the only answer should be to keep it. It keeps the election fair by giving smaller states a bigger impact.

 the Electoral College keep the election fair because all state be represent proportianly to the population of the state this allow for the small state to have a more impactful vote on the president since each state be represent equally the election be more fair than if just a popular vote be take this system be call unfair by some because they think that their vote be not be hear this be not true because in source one it say that when you be vote for a president you be actually vote for who your elector be go to vote for so if you vote say democratic that s a vote go toward the elector vote democratic in turn he or her voting democratic for the president 

 if the president be elect by a popular vote there be a risk of runoff election as show in case three when nixon have 43 percent of the popular vote but win the Electoral College allow for a fair winner to be elect if we continue to use the Electoral College a clear winner will always be produce but if we go by popular vote a runoff election can occur some people may say that the Electoral College be unfair because the winner of the popular vote may not win because of the Electoral College vote and that be not true if the president be elect by popular vote he or she who be run can just go for the big state win they over and all small state be leave with no significant say in the election 

 if the Electoral College be not use it would allow presidential candidate to favor different region make it seem like he or she be just the south president or the north ect so with the Electoral College it make the candidate branch out to try and win more state that they usually would not try to appeal to in source two the speaker say the electoral college be unfair to voter because of the winnertakeall system in each state candidate do n't spend time in state they know they have no chance win this statement be not true because the Electoral College force the candidate to branch out to get more vote and if the runner know he or she wo n't win that state why spend money and other resource on a regardless cause 

 when all be consider about keep the Electoral College the only answer should be to keep it it keep the election fair by give small state a big impact it keep runoff election from take place and make the candidate branch out to other state"

Subject: Keeping the Electoral College for the Presidential Election

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method of selecting the President of the United States. While there are arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that make it a crucial component of our democratic system. In considering this issue, I have carefully reviewed several sources, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Unlike a popular vote system, where a dispute over the result can easily arise, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This was evident in the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote. The winner-take-all basis in most states also ensures that even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral vote victory. Therefore, the Electoral College system minimizes the likelihood of post-election disputes.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the president is ""everyone's president."" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents a scenario where a candidate with only regional support becomes the president and neglects the interests of other regions. By requiring candidates to appeal to a diverse range of voters, the Electoral College promotes a more inclusive and representative presidency.

Moreover, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in the Electoral College system motivates candidates to campaign in swing states. As seen in the 2012 election, candidates focused their efforts on toss-up states, where the election outcome is uncertain. This increases voter engagement and encourages thoughtful voting, as voters in swing states become crucial in deciding the election. By prioritizing the concerns and interests of states that are not firmly aligned with either party, the Electoral College forces candidates to address a wider range of issues.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of big and small states. Large states, which suffer from the mal-apportionment of the Senate, regain some weight in the political balance through the allocation of electoral votes. A victory by a slight margin in a large state, such as Florida, yields a significant number of electoral votes, while a similar victory in a small state, like Wyoming, results in fewer electoral votes. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on large population centers and gives smaller states a voice in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as seen in the cases of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. This prevents the elections from becoming more complex and expensive with the requirement of run-off elections.

While I understand that opponents of the Electoral College argue that it is unfair and outdated, I believe that the advantages it offers outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College promotes stability, ensures a more inclusive presidency, encourages candidates to address the concerns of swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College for the presidential election. It is integral to our democratic system and provides a fair and effective means of selecting the President of the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I hope that you will consider my perspective in your decision-making process.

Yours sincerely,

2006,0,"In recent times, we have faced numerous environmental challenges that can be attributed to the over-reliance on automobiles for transportation. Excessive car usage is responsible for an alarming increase in greenhouse gas emissions, urban smog, and overall environmental degradation. By limiting car usage, we may significantly improve our environment and overall quality of life.

One of the key justifications for limiting car usage is environmental preservation. Cars, especially those that run on diesel and petrol, are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting the use of cars, we can significantly reduce such emissions and contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can substantially reduce air pollution. Several cities have started implementing partial car bans and observed substantial improvement in air quality. For instance, Paris, faced with near-record levels of smog, enforced a partial driving ban, leading to a 60% drop in congestion and better air quality (Duffer, 2014). Bogota, Colombia, has also adopted the concept of ""car-free"" days, encouraging residents to use alternative modes of transport, leading to an improvement in air quality and a decrease in the everyday stress associated with traffic (Selsky, 2002). 

Moreover, reducing car usage can lead to healthier and more active lifestyles. For example, in the car-free suburb of Vauban, residents walk and bike more frequently, leading to an increase in physical activity and overall well-being (Rosenthal, 2009). By reducing dependency on cars and encouraging walking or cycling, we can promote healthier lifestyles while helping to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

Moving toward limited car usage also paves the way to advanced urban planning, fostering public transportation, and walkable communities. The suburban experiment in Vauban has demonstrated that with smart planning, it is possible to create settlements that are less car-dependent (Rosenthal, 2009). This not only helps in reducing carbon emissions but also inculcates a sense of community among the residents and fosters sustainable living. 

In conclusion, reducing car usage offers multiple advantages including environmental preservation, improved air quality, healthier lifestyles, and advanced urban planning. As we progress toward a future dominated by climate change concerns and sustainability considerations, limiting car usage offers a significant step in this direction. It is incumbent upon us all to embrace sustainable practices like using public transportation, walking, biking, or carpooling to contribute to a healthier planet and a brighter future.",1,"in recent time we have face numerous environmental challenge that can be attribute to the over reliance on automobile for transportation excessive car usage be responsible for an alarming increase in greenhouse gas emission urban smog and overall environmental degradation by limit car usage we may significantly improve our environment and overall quality of life

1035,1,"I argue in changing the electoral college , popular vote would be a chance for normal americans to get there voice heard in the government. A big problem is how the voters votes go straight to the electoral college and wouldnt make a change at all also how theres a bigger chance of a tie happening in the electoral college then by popular vote One reason why the electoral college should go is because the voters votes arent really being heard. For example in paragraph 10 it says that ' under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors who in turn elect for the president "" , thats techinally saying that the electors are the ones who are really voting our voice means nothing we could have wanted another president to have won but if the electoral college gets more votes then us then so be it , thats our new president! We dont even know who the electors really are they could have been picked by anyone like how it says in paragraph 10 they could have been picked by the presidential candidates themselves who knows. They say we control who the electors vote for but not always , theres a high unlikely chance that there would be more popular votes for one president like in texas for john kerry that all 34 electors would go to congress and vote for john kerry thats insane.

A second reason is how theres a bigger chance of electoral college tie happening then a popular vote one like how it says in paragraph 12 "" in 1916 , a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and a 3,3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe"". If the electoral college has a tie then theres even a bigger chance of the people voice not being heard at all. Once a tie happens the election goes to the house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president as said in paragraph 12 , a single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters, would have no say compared to the 55 representatives from California that makes Wyoming have no voice in the election compared to california. The house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

Finally thats all i have to say regarding how the election should be changed to having the popular vote determine the president , we want our voice to be heard! Sometimes the electoral college doesnt pick the president that we wanted and if there was a tie to happen in the electoral college which is at high risk some of the states voices wouldnt get heard at all , thats why we should switch over to popular vote maybe more people would actually get up and go vote because they would know their vote actually means something. Like it says in paragraph 14 "" Abolish the electoral college!

1382,0,"Limiting car usage holds multifaceted advantages for individuals and communities alike, contributing significantly to environmental sustainability, public health, and urban development. As citizens, it is crucial to understand the far-reaching impacts of our transportation choices and consider alternative modes that align with a more responsible and conscientious approach to mobility.

A primary advantage of reducing car usage centers around environmental conservation. According to a comprehensive study conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the transportation sector, predominantly fueled by automobiles, is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. By limiting our reliance on cars and embracing greener alternatives such as walking, cycling, or public transit, we can collectively reduce carbon footprints. This shift is pivotal in mitigating climate change and preserving the delicate ecological balance on which our planet relies.

Public health emerges as another compelling reason to advocate for reduced car usage. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that vehicular emissions contribute significantly to air pollution, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. By choosing sustainable transportation options, individuals can actively contribute to improving air quality, resulting in healthier living environments. A reduction in pollution-related health issues not only enhances the well-being of citizens but also alleviates the strain on healthcare systems, fostering a healthier and more resilient society.

Beyond the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage positively influences urban development. A study published in the Journal of Urban Economics indicates that areas with efficient public transit systems experience reduced traffic congestion and urban sprawl. This fosters more compact, walkable communities that prioritize accessibility and environmental consciousness. Embracing alternative transportation methods not only enhances the overall quality of life but also contributes to the creation of sustainable and vibrant urban spaces.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage extend far beyond individual preferences, encompassing global concerns such as climate change, public health, and urban planning. As responsible citizens, we have the power to shape our communities by making informed choices about transportation. By embracing alternatives and advocating for sustainable practices, we can collectively work towards a future where mobility is not at the expense of the environment and well-being but rather a harmonious integration of individual and communal needs.",1,"limit car usage hold multifaceted advantage for individual and community alike contribute significantly to environmental sustainability public health and urban development as citizen it be crucial to understand the far reach impact of our transportation choice and consider alternative mode that align with a more responsible and conscientious approach to mobility

165,1,"It is often said that ""change is good."" This saying is one way to describe my feelings towards the Electoral College. The sources ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner show the pros and cons of the Electoral College. The Electoral College should be taken over by popular votes because all Americans should have a say in who their next leader will be.

The Electoral Collegemay disregard what their voters say and vote for another candidate to be our next President. In paragraph 11 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it is declared that ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate."" Voting citizens of America vote for a reason. They vote for who they want to be President, not who the party's electives want to be President. Voters should be able to trust their electors, otherwise their votes are going to a candidate they voted against. Another key point of this unjust way of voting is that people have to put their trust into unknown electors. It is stated in paragraph 16 of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner ""each of the party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee."" These electors may be ""trusted"", but to the unknowing voters of America they are ordinary people who could betray someone very easily. All it takes is one elector disobeying his promise to the candidate he chose to represent to have the fate of American changed.

The winner of the election may lose by popular vote and win by electoral votes. This is an unfair advantage that the Electoral College has to the common voters. Voters expect to vote for who they selected, not who the Electoral College selects. It is emphasized in paragraph 10 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer in which ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors."" In simpler terms, this is saying you don't vote for the next leader, you vote for people who may choose the next leader. The people of America vote for a reason, to choose our next leader who will support our country. They don't vote to have a College of unknown Electors choose the next President. It should also be noted that you're technically not even voting for a President. It is disputed in paragraph sixof ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" In other words, you don't even choose your candidate, just people who are trusted to vote for them. American voterswant to for the nex president, not a board of Electors that they are unsure will trust them.

On the contrary, there is the possibility of it being a very close election where it would require the Electoral College to choose a President. In paragraph 18 of the source ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""Richard A. Posnerstates ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The popular vote might be back and forth between the Presidents, but an electoral vote would create more of a landslide win. In the end, the cons of the Electoral College outweigh the pros of it.

1499,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. As shown in the passages, there are several benefits to implementing measures that reduce the reliance on cars and promote alternative modes of transportation.

One significant advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to air pollution and climate change. In Europe, cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can reach up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can effectively reduce these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive impacts on individuals' well-being. The passages highlight that many residents who have given up their cars in Vauban, Germany, experienced improved quality of life. One resident mentioned feeling less stressed and happier without a car. This can be attributed to various factors, such as reduced traffic congestion, noise pollution, and the promotion of alternative modes of transportation like walking and cycling. These activities not only help individuals stay physically active but also create a more vibrant and connected community.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient land use. Traditional suburban development centered around car use has often resulted in spread-out homes and vast parking areas. These developments contribute to urban sprawl and the loss of green spaces. However, smart planning strategies, as seen in Vauban and other communities, propose more compact and accessible suburbs with less space dedicated to cars. By placing stores and amenities within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation, these developments promote sustainable land use and foster a sense of community.

Limiting car usage also supports the development of alternative transportation infrastructure. As highlighted in the passages, there are efforts to improve public transportation systems and make them more accessible to suburban areas. This shift can lead to better public transportation services, reduced traffic congestion, and increased mobility options for individuals who do not own cars. Additionally, it can incentivize the use of greener modes of transportation such as bicycles and electric vehicles.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are significant. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving individuals' well-being, promoting efficient land use, and developing alternative transportation infrastructure, we can create more sustainable and livable communities. It is essential to prioritize these measures to address the environmental challenges we face and create a better future for all.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

1171,1,"Dear State Senator, It has come to my attention the many problems that the Electoral College has. I would like to ask that we change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. You see, not only is the Electoral College unfair, but it also creates a lie that tricks everyone into believing that our President was the one that the majority of America voted for, when that is not always the case.

First off, the fact that the number of electors for each state relies on the number of members in it's Congressional delegation is just illogical...lets say Florida has twenty because of its size, and California has fifty. if both states want to vote for someone different, then California is going to win only because of the size and population difference. So really, you aren't voting for the president...you're voting for the electors who will choose the president. An argument can be made against this...that the electors that you give your vote to will be trustworthy and vote for the person that your party wants. How does that give us a say though? For example, as it says in the article, Al Gore was the president that the majority of America voted for in 2000...he was the one that everyone wanted. Yet he lost the presidency because of this form of voting. This is a free country, or so we're told, so we need to be given the right of popular vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system is flawed...there are millions of people in America and yet only 538 votes are counted. There is no way to be assured that the person you voted for, or anyone else, was selected. We need to ask ourselves what the best thing is for our country... letting everybody be dissapointed in who was voted for, or seeing that they got what they spent time on going and voting on. This isn't just a captain for a football team, or a manager at work. This is the president of the United States, and he or she will be running our country for 4 years or even longer, so we need to question this method of voting. We are a unified country, and our unity shows what we want as a country..we shouldn't have one thing chosen and get something completely different in return. The election by popular voting would be a better overall choice for our country.

All in all, arguments can be made both ways...for the Electoral College process or against it. The citizens of America deserve the very best person to lead them, and that's exactly who we should get...the one that America votes for. I know that there are more efficient and fair ways to do this, all we need to do is use them. At the end of the day though, using the election by popular vote would ensure that everyone would be 100% sure that their vote went for who they wanted, and that's what counts.",0,"Dear State Senator it have come to my attention the many problem that the Electoral College have I would like to ask that we change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States you see not only be the Electoral College unfair but it also create a lie that trick everyone into believe that our President be the one that the majority of America vote for when that be not always the case

782,1,"Dear me. Senator, ever since the Presidential Election of 2000, the concept of our electoral college has been highly scrutinized, and this is rightly so. The electoral college is undemocratic, unfair, and should be replaced with the popular vote.

Even people who support keeping the electoral college such as the author of In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , Richard A. Posner agree that ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense.."" paragraph 15. America was founded on democracy and making sure that the people's voices were heard, and not allowing the people to directly vote for the leader of the country goes against that.

The electoral college is also extremely unfair to voters. Because of how the election system is set up, a candidate could win the people's popular vote, but not the electoral votes and would then not receive presidency. This occurred in 2000 in the Gore vs Busch election. Even though a majority of people voted for Gore, Busch still ended up with the presidency paragraph 9. Having the electoral votes take precedence over the popular vote takes away the people's voice and basically tells them that their opinion doesn't matter as much as the electoral college's opinion.

The electoral college is also unfair because it discourages campaigning in nonswing states. A democratic candidate would not campaign in a state like California that is heavily democratic because they know they are almost definitely going to win the election in that state, meaning they will get all of that state's electoral votes. A republican candidate would not campaign in california either because they know they would have almost no chance of winning in such a heavily democratic state, and they would be wasting campaign money with no hope of electoral votes from that state paragraph 13. This means that people in nonswing states like California don't really know much about either candidate because they were never informed. Then the people in these states tend to vote for their party solely because they have nothing else to go off of. It is unfair for voters in nonswing states to be left in the dark just because all of the electoral votes are almost guaranteed to go one way. If the US used popular votes for the Presidential Election, republicans in democratic states and democrats in republican states would have a voice too.

Another way the electoral college is unfair, is the standing procedure in the event of a tie. There are 538 electors in the electoral college paragraph 3 which is an even number, meaning the electoral votes for each candidate could be tied. In the event of a tie, the House of Representatives would have an election and each state would get one vote. That would mean ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" paragraph 12. This would make someone from California's vote count for much less than someone from Wyomig's vote.

It can be argued that the electoral college is beneficial in the fact that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds his share of popular votes. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to 51.3% of popular votes paragraph 18. Some say this is beneficial because it reduces the chance of a dispute of vote counting. However, this is actually not a good thing. 51.3% of people wanted Obama to be President. Not 61.7%. Yet Obama still got credit for 61.7%. About 10% of voters who didn't support Obama didn't get their opinion heard.

The electoral college has been around for a long time, and it's time for a change. It is simply undemocratic and unfair. It prevents every person for having an equally weighted vote. The electoral college needs to be replaced with a popular vote.

62,1,"Dear State Senator, I think that we should change the election by popular vote for the President of the United States instead of keeping the electoral college. The reasons I think that we should have it changed to the popular vote is because I think the people should be able to choose who should be our next president instead of having the electoral college also voting for the president of the United States.

Its not only me senator, but also these important men of our country all agree with me that we need to abolish the electoral college! These men are Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. Chamber of commerce.""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor."" I just find all of this unfair because its not just the United states giving there opinion on who should be there next leader but some other men who have favoritism for the opponents also vote too! One example of how i think the electoral college voters are unfair is back in the election of President Obama and Mr. rodney the electoral voters had 29 electoral votes for Obama and rodney only had 3. So, that election could have been more fair if we didnt have so much favoritism for one person to another. When we could have had a fair vote from the people and had the opinions on who should be there next President.

Now, in the defese of the electoral college it does help situations in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast which can be very helpful when examples happen like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 when they both had only 43 percent of the popular votes and the electoral college helped not make those elections as complicated. But, they still had a say so on who should be president and who shouldnt be president. I think that question should be answered by our own people!

Thank you so much State Senator for reading my opinion on the electoral college versus the popular vote for the President of the United States.",0,"Dear State Senator I think that we should change the election by popular vote for the President of the United States instead of keep the electoral college the reason I think that we should have it change to the popular vote be because I think the people should be able to choose who should be our next president instead of have the electoral college also vote for the president of the United States

925,1,"The presidential elections are a huge deal in the United States and everywhere else. We all sit on anticipation to see who our next leader is hoping that they will make great changed for their country and their people, eventually making it a great place to live. Not many people are well informed about this system we have here, and some are. But could you imagine if more people find out that they aren't actually voting for the President but instead your are voting for the people that are voting for the President? Does that make any sense? As you very well know there are two sides to every story Senater. Many people agree with the electoral Collage and many people don't. However my personal belief is that you should not support the electoral Collage. I believe that this system is unfair, it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and who's running the country as well as the fact that many people voted for the electoral Collage may make the wrong decisions which could jeopardize the election and lets not forget about the winner take all system.

To begin with, the first reason I don't think you should support the electoral Collage is because the system is unfair and it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and their results. During Election time people are tricked into thinking that they are voting for the President. They play Presidential ad for campaigns and the candidates go give speeches around the country. But if your not really voting for the Presidents, then why are they wasting all this money and wasting your time having you watch the ads. Source two it says "" If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of thirtyfour electoral votes. Who are the electors?"" amd in source 1 it says ""THe fouding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise."" But honest is it really a compromise is you're not involved? People want to be involved in this type of stuff, believe it or not it matters to them. And because you are not really told, people could go on for years thinking that their voting for the actual President but instead they are voting for politicans and hoping that they make the right decisions. Are we really going to leave the fait of our country up to hope and up to people that don't really know what their voting for. This is not fair and it doesn't live up to American values.

Another reason that you shouldn't support the electoral Collage is because many of the politicans that people vote for make the wrong decisions and could jeopardize the future of our country. Everyone makes mistakes but in presidential elections you can't, it is veyr important that things are monitered closely. After all you are voting for a person who is going to run and represent your country. But many politicians feel that since they have power that they can do whatever they want. Even go as far as rigging election votes so they can win. in source two it states that ""Those electors could always defy the will of the people."" In other words they may not listen to what the people want and instead be selfish and listen to what they want. Now of course we know this isn't right. ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" This isn't fair to the people, because by doing that you are saying they don't have a say. And people have a lot of trouble trusting politicians, would you blame them it's not every day that you come across a person who wants the best for their people and puts them first instead of themselves.

The final reason that you shouldn't approve or support the electoral System is because of the ""Winners take all"" system. In this system candidates really don't bother going or speaking or visiting the state their running in. This basically means that the people who vote for them are making a blind vote without really knowing the person. Before voting for anyone in any situation student council, Goverment, and ect. You need to know that person. You need to make sure that they share the same values that you do. You need to make sure that they are the best candidate for the state and not some random street alcoholic. People have enough trouble trusting politicans as it is why make it worse? ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all."" This statement also includes political ads, they saw none at all. And you expect them to vote for the President of the United States without prior knowledge how is that even allowed? That is why I call it a blind vote.

However even in the midst of all that wrong with electoral System people have found right in it. For instance source 3 says that ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed."" Although this statement has some truth to it, it also has some false. The problem that i have with that statement is that there are no facts to back it up. Sure you believe that our trust is rarely betrayed but actually you don't know. Politicans are very secrative and protected at all cost. You have no ideas what going on in their office unless they make a public announcement on it and sometimes that's even a lie. We don't know our politicans really well on a personal basis, sure you might think you do because they go on tv shows tell you about their life but how much of that is truth and how much is lie? Sometimes politicans lie to protect the people from pain or ect. But you shouldn't being doing that in the middle of one of the most important elections the country ever has. And if we mess up some how the only way we fix it is either impeaching the president or waiting another four years to hopefully make sure things go right and get a good President. Are you willing to take that chance?

To reiterate the bottom line is that these electoral Collages are important. The people we select in our office are important. However if we let our people become involved in actual Presidental elections we are leaving the future of our country up to hope and to people who make the wrong decisions as well as the ""Winner takes all system."" Is that really what we want for our country? People need to be involved thats why its called The United States of American. We are suppose to be united. Sure our government could be a little corrupt at times but maybe by letting people become more involved we may actually be looking forward to a brighter and better America. Which is what we all want.",0,"the presidential election be a huge deal in the United States and everywhere else we all sit on anticipation to see who our next leader be hope that they will make great change for their country and their people eventually make it a great place to live not many people be well informed about this system we have here and some be but could you imagine if more people find out that they be n't actually vote for the President but instead your be vote for the people that be vote for the President do that make any sense as you very well know there be two side to every story Senater many people agree with the electoral Collage and many people do n't however my personal belief be that you should not support the electoral Collage I believe that this system be unfair it do n't give Americans full control over election and who be run the country as well as the fact that many people vote for the electoral Collage may make the wrong decision which could jeopardize the election and lets not forget about the winner take all system

Dear Senator [Senator's Full Name],

I am writing this letter to express my views on the ongoing debate over whether the United States should maintain the Electoral College or switch to a purely popular vote system for presidential elections. After examining available evidence and studies, I have concluded that we should retain the Electoral College.

While some may argue the Electoral College is undemocratic, considering a candidate can lose the popular vote but still win the presidency, this has only happened a few times in our nation’s history (Posner, 16). Furthermore, the Electoral College offers a level of certainty in outcomes that a national popular vote lacks. It reduces the possibility of nationwide vote recounts, as a candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote (Posner, 18).

In addition, one critical benefit of the Electoral College often overlooked is its reinforcement of the Federalism principle. The Electoral College ensures a president has a diverse, broad range of support from across the country. Electoral votes are distributed across states, thus obliging candidates to campaign in various parts of the country with diverse economic, cultural, and social interests (Posner, 19).

Critics of the Electoral College argue that the system encourages candidates to focus only on “swing states”, where the competition is close, leaving other states neglected (Plumer, 13). However, as Judge Posner posits, this can be seen as an advantage. It encourages voters in these states to pay more attention to the campaign having in mind that they decide the election. They tend to be the most informed and engaged voters (Posner, 20).

This is not to discount the faults the Electoral College carries. For instance, the issue of ""faithless electors"" disregarding their constituents' wishes is concerning (Plumer, 11). Yet, problems like these are typically exceptional and can be resolved through state laws binding electors’ votes to their state’s popular vote—most states have already done so.

Finally, it’s important to consider the potential chaos a transition to a purely popular vote could cause. With no provision for runoff votes at a national level, a field crowded with third-party candidates could lead to a president getting elected with far less than 50% of the national vote (Posner, 22). 

While the push toward a more direct democracy is worthwhile, immediate abolition of the Electoral College is not the answer. A comprehensive reform that guarantees the will of the people and respects the unique system of government in the United States is needed.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my views on this important subject. I strongly feel that keeping the Electoral College, perhaps with some necessary adjustments, is in our best interest.

Sincerely,

 while some may argue the Electoral College be undemocratic consider a candidate can lose the popular vote but still win the presidency this have only happen a few time in our nation ’s history Posner 16 furthermore the Electoral College offer a level of certainty in outcome that a national popular vote lack it reduce the possibility of nationwide vote recount as a candidate ’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceed their share of the popular vote Posner 18 

 in addition one critical benefit of the Electoral College often overlook be its reinforcement of the Federalism principle the Electoral College ensure a president have a diverse broad range of support from across the country electoral vote be distribute across state thus obliging candidate to campaign in various part of the country with diverse economic cultural and social interest Posner 19 

 critic of the Electoral College argue that the system encourage candidate to focus only on swing state where the competition be close leave other state neglect Plumer 13 however as Judge Posner posit this can be see as an advantage it encourage voter in these state to pay more attention to the campaign have in mind that they decide the election they tend to be the most informed and engage voter Posner 20 

 this be not to discount the fault the Electoral College carry for instance the issue of faithless elector disregard their constituent wish be concern Plumer 11 yet problem like these be typically exceptional and can be resolve through state law bind elector vote to their state ’s popular vote most state have already do so 

 finally it be important to consider the potential chaos a transition to a purely popular vote could cause with no provision for runoff vote at a national level a field crowd with third party candidate could lead to a president getting elect with far less than 50 of the national vote Posner 22 

 while the push toward a more direct democracy be worthwhile immediate abolition of the Electoral College be not the answer a comprehensive reform that guarantee the will of the people and respect the unique system of government in the United States be need 

 thank you for take the time to consider my view on this important subject I strongly feel that keep the Electoral College perhaps with some necessary adjustment be in our good interest 

 sincerely

1993,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage 

In today's global society, there is an increasing recognition of the environmental, social, and health benefits derived from reducing car usage. Various measures are being implemented worldwide to encourage less dependency on personal motorized vehicles and promote alternative transportation. 

Vauban, Germany, an upscale suburb, is an epitome of this concept. Implemented in 2006, the Vauban model reveals that it is feasible to lead a suburban life without heavily relying on cars (Rosenthal 8). Families in Vauban have renounced car ownership in favor of a neighborhood design that emphasizes walking, bicycling, and public transit. By reducing car usage, Vauban has successfully created a space where the chatter of children and the whisper of bicycles are prominent instead of the constant hum of engines (Rosenthal 3). This approach improves the residents' quality of life by reducing noise, stress, and air pollution while encouraging communal interactions and physical activities. 

On a larger scale, curtailing car usage substantially aids in reducing harmful emissions into the environment. In the context of greenhouse gas emissions, passenger cars are major contributors, especially in car-intensive regions like the United States (Rosenthal 5). An important advantage of limiting car use is the significant decrease in these emissions, which helms the global fight against climate change. 

Moreover, this idea is being adopted not just in developed countries but also in developing nations. In Bogota, Colombia, a ""Day Without Cars"" aims to underline the use of alternative transportation while decreasing smog levels (Selsky 21). The event was positively received, indicating that such efforts can be successful and adopted in other regions.

Paris, France, implemented a similar strategy by imposing a temporary driving ban to alleviate severe smog that had gripped the city (Duffer 10). This approach was successful in curbing air pollution levels significantly, by decreasing congestion and harmful car emissions (Duffer 14). These practices demonstrate how adapting car-free or car-reduced living can swiftly impact air quality, which in turn benefits public health by reducing respiratory issues linked to poor air quality.

Notably, there seems to be a latent shift in the American lifestyle, which enjoys a notorious reputation for being car-centric. There is evidence signaling that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses (Rosenthal 29). This development suggests that the cultural significance of cars is fading, replaced instead by an appreciation for “mobilities,” including walking, bicycling, and public transit (Rosenthal 35). This shift benefits the environment and, at the same time, responds to modern urbanization pressures such as traffic congestion and limited parking space. 

Conclusively, restricting car usage offers a multi-faceted approach to tackling environmental issues, enhancing the quality of life, and dealing with urban space constraints. As more cities and suburbs adopt policies to decrease the dependency on cars, the trend towards sustainable and equitable transportation will strengthen. It is a model conducive to not just a healthier environment, but also stronger, more communal, and happier societies.",1,"title the advantage of limit car usage

362,1,"The Electoral College is a cruel, pointless process that simply makes a percentage of votes, or all of them if you look at it that way, to mean nothing, and allows for circumstances like the 2000 election. There are plenty of reasons, and plenty of contradictions in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" To begin, the winnertakeall system is very unfair to the voters. Voters in certain, dominated areas are supposed to know what they are voting for, yet get nothing to teach them? Not that it matters regardless, since every person within a state supports a political party, right, and, depending on your state's veiw, all RepublicansDemocrats have no idea what they are voting for, correct? Like Bradford Plumer says, you shouldn't have to move to Ohio to be able to get a vote. There is also the point countered me. poster's article, which is that those in partydominated states will have a feeling their vote doesn't count, and he sais that one vote will not swing an election. Then why do you believe an upside of the electoral college is that those in more neutral states will feel their vote counts? Or do those in partydominated states not matter, since those in neutrals think way more about their votes, and are the only ones you should trust, according to him? In practice, they are the only deciding factor.

There are also the many unwanted results from electoral colleges, such as the 2000 election's outcome defying the people. ""What Is the Electoral College?"" states you are voting for electors when you vote, but what is the point if they can simply defy you? It would be like if after the president was chosen, the Senate could overule him with a 15 vote. There is also the point in plumber's article about the time Hawaii sent two slates, which forced the desicion to Nixon, who had to validate only the opponent's votes in fear of otherwise receiving bad publicity. There is also the strange way of resolving a tie, which boils down to the same thing as the winnertakeall system, except if more people support it doesn't matter. It would be like if everybody in the room wasn't alowed to vote, other than one voted, but everybody in the room agreed anyway for some strange, miraculous reason. Of course, the one guy in the next room doesn't agree, and completely takes out your vote, regardless of the fact that there were 30 people in this one.

Now, there is the gregarious amount of contradictory statements that can be found within me. poster's article. One has already been mentioned in the winnertakeall system paragraph. He also conveintly provides a dispute that had nothing to do with a close vote in the Electoral College, and everything to do with what is wrong with this winnertakeall system, being the 2000 election. In the same paragraph, me mentions how an Electoral tie is highly unlikely as if a tie between the millions of US citizens is. His reason 5 can be easily solved by simply giving the presidency to the candidate who receives a plurality of votes, rather than a majority. Reasons number 3 and 4 both contradict reason 2 as well, stating that everybody gets a vote, only swing states should get a vote, and only bigger states should get a vote even when there is a 5149 split, where 51%100%, mind you.

Thus, the Electoral College is completely unfair to voters, and should be abolished. Voters should not have to vote for other votes which could very well defy their's, why not just have the Electoral Cllege do all the voting then? It is both redundant and unfair.",0,"the Electoral College be a cruel pointless process that simply make a percentage of vote or all of they if you look at it that way to mean nothing and allow for circumstance like the 2000 election there be plenty of reason and plenty of contradiction in in Defense of the Electoral College five reason to keep our despised method of choose the President to begin the winnertakeall system be very unfair to the voter voter in certain dominate area be suppose to know what they be vote for yet get nothing to teach they not that it matter regardless since every person within a state support a political party right and depend on your state 's veiw all RepublicansDemocrats have no idea what they be vote for correct like Bradford Plumer say you should n't have to move to Ohio to be able to get a vote there be also the point counter I poster 's article which be that those in partydominate state will have a feeling their vote do n't count and he sai that one vote will not swing an election then why do you believe an upside of the electoral college be that those in more neutral state will feel their vote count or do those in partydominate state not matter since those in neutral think way more about their vote and be the only one you should trust accord to he in practice they be the only decide factor

1242,1,"Dear Senator, The Presidential Election is one of the most important events that goes on in the United States. At the core of this election is the Electoral College. The only problem is, the college has many flaws. Like in Source 1, it states that our Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election by a popular vote from the citizens who qualify. As you know the E.C consists of the selection of electorss, meeting of electorss where they vote for the President and Vice, and the counting of the votes by Congress. There are 538 electorss, 538 votes, and it takes a majority of 270 votes to win the election. This flawed system has been around too long and it needs to be altered. I am in favor of getting rid of the E.C and going to winner by a popular vote.

If the Presidential candidate is favored by more than 50% of the country then he or she should win. Like in Source 2 history shows that in the past candidates have clearly won the popular vote, but sill lost the presidency race. The problem with the current system we have in place is that the people who are supposed to have a direct voice in the government do not. Instead the people vote for other people who they are supposed to trust vote in favor of their opinion. I can see how some people believe in this system of trust, however some history has shown us otherwise.

History has shown that electorss can go against the opinion of the public. When you vote for electorss most of the time they in turn vote for what the people want. The only thing is you are not ensured that this will occur. In the end it is up to the electors who can decide however they wish. Personally for the U.S. it would be more effective to go to winner by popular vote, not only because of the unsureness of the electorss, but also because that is what the people want. Another valid argument to get rid of the whole Electoral College process is in Source 2, it states that sometimes voters get confused with the electorss and vote for the wrong candidate. That could be detrimental to the country if the wrong person for the job was elected. If it was the popular vote sytem the selection of candidates would be clear and easy to understand, which leads to less mistakes when voting.

The view of getting rid of the Electoral College is actually quite popular. In Source 2 it tells us Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and others have all agreed that we should abolish the Electoral College. Going all the way back to the beginning of our country we started off on the base principle that the people must have a direct voice in the government. That is the reason our country was made a democracy. The Electoral College has bent those principles and hasn't fully allowed the voice of the people to be heard. With the popular vote put in place their are no middle men, it is just the people voicing what they want and who they want to represent them.

Looking over the information that has been presented it is clear that the Electoral College has to go. The system is flawed for many reasons such as the popular candidate not winning, voices not being ensured that they will be heard, and the confusing system of not voting directly for your President. If the change of winner by popular vote in the election is made none of the previous flaws will be present. The popular vote sytem will ensure the people get what they want and the process is completely fair. For these reasons it is in our society's best interest that our government makes this change. Abolish the Electoral College and bring on a new age of simple and fair elections!

15,0,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage in our community. Other countries such as France, Germany, and Colombia are home to cities that are working towards cutting down the use of personal automobiles. Many of the people in these places find that using alternative transportation means proves to be less stressful. Studies even show that fewer Americans are purchasing cars for themselves. Now is the perfect time to join in with Vauban, Bogota, and New York and spend less time in our cars.

It may seem hard to believe, but in Germany, there's a suburban area where residents live without their own cars. According to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the streets of Vauban, Germany remain ""carfree"" aside from some public transport. The article states that ""70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."". Heidrun Walter was quoted in the excerpt saying ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way..."" Communities in Europe and the United States are hoping to move towards this ""carfree"" lifestyle, in order to become less dependent on automobile usage and cut back on greenhouse gas emissions that damage the environment. We may see an increase in the number of ""smart planning"" areas across the globe. If a mass of citizens wish to lessen the amount of time they spend in their cars, it's possible, and the city can adapt to a more automobileless way of life.

Bogota, Columbia dedicates a day to transportation without the use of personal cars, where the city's goal is ""...to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"". Many who visit Bogota during this time are impressed by the ""revolutionary change"" they see unfold before their eyes. Going ""carfree"" leads to more physical activity amongst residents and an overall nicerlooking community. ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky claims ""Parks and sports centers... have bloomed throughout the city... sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... restaraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."". Not only does the city reduce the amount of greenhouse gas it contributes to the atmosphere, but it results in a more active and betterlooking community.

What change would we see in our own community were we to follow in the footsteps of Bogota and Vauban? The United States is seeing a decrease of car ownership in the country. Less and less people are buying automoblies and obtaining driver's licenses. ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal says that ""...America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling."" The writer cites investment research company Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, which states ""...the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter..."" The country is already subconsciously moving towards a more carindependent lifestyle. The millenial generation seems to be the biggest contributor to this declined interest in carownership. With improved methods of communication by means of social media and cellphones, as well as more use of carpooling and public transportation, people are staving away from car commuting. While this may require a change within the automobile industry, many agree that this turning away from private car usage will see communities striving to be more time and energy efficient when it comes to transportation.

Limiting the use of cars can lead to a less polluted and stressful environment, more exerciseoriented and upscale communities, and the conservation of our natural resources. Cities around the world are working to become less cardependent, so that they may limit their contribution of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Were our community to move towards this more ecofriendly, carfree way of life, we would not be alone.",0,"there be many advantage to limit car usage in our community other country such as France Germany and Colombia be home to city that be work towards cut down the use of personal automobile many of the people in these place find that use alternative transportation mean prove to be less stressful study even show that few Americans be purchase car for themselves now be the perfect time to join in with Vauban Bogota and New York and spend less time in our car

552,1,"Dear Senator, I believe that is is time to get rid of the electoral college. The electoral college is outdated and irrational, the best arguments are only assertions that dont have much basis in reality.

There are too many faults and risks in the electoral college such as the coming of a tie in the voting and that even though one candidate may win the popular vote they can still lose the election. As Bradford Plumer says ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" paragraph 9. It would be better in elections for it to go by popular vote instead of representatives deciding for you. A solution for this could be to simply go by popular vote. There is also the fact that the electors could defy the will of the people.

The electors are not trust worthy. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" Bradford paragraph 11. They did this so the popular vote would not actually go to Kennedy. In the past electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote on whomever they want. People are thinking we have ""faithless"" electors because of this. We need to select electors that we can trust will go by the states overall decision instead of their own personal preference.

It is hard to vote for the president not knowing if your vote is actually going to mean anything. Us as voters cannot control what the electors do and who they vote for, we just have to hope that our candidate wins. Us as voters also sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The voters need to know that their vote is going to mean something for the candidates running and that their decision will be taken into consideration.

Subject: Support for the Electoral College or Proposing a Change to Popular Vote for Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and to argue in favor of either keeping the current system or changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After considering the information from various sources, including the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democratic process and should be retained.

Firstly, it is important to understand the purpose of the Electoral College as outlined in the Constitution. The founding fathers established it as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a direct popular vote (Office of the Federal Register). By doing so, they sought to ensure that both the will of the people and the interests of individual states are accounted for in the presidential election process.

One of the major advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty it brings to the outcome of the election (Judge Richard A. Posner). Since the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, disputes over the results are less likely in comparison to a direct popular vote system. Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that a candidate must have broad regional appeal in order to secure the presidency (Judge Richard A. Posner). This prevents presidents from solely representing the interests of specific regions and promotes the idea of a president who is accountable to the entire nation.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, which ensures that these states receive more attention and consideration from the candidates (Judge Richard A. Posner). This promotes a fair and balanced electoral process in which voters in swing states play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the election.

The system of winner-take-all allocation of electoral votes also offers an advantage to larger states, ensuring that they receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns (Judge Richard A. Posner). This is particularly important in balancing out the disproportionate influence of smaller states due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, as prescribed by the Constitution.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as the unfairness to voters in non-swing states and the potential for a tie or disputed outcome, the benefits of the current system outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College has stood the test of time, ensuring stability and representation within our democratic republic.

In conclusion, I strongly advocate for the retention of the Electoral College or considering changes within the existing system, such as proportional allocation of electoral votes, while maintaining the overall framework. The Electoral College embraces the principles of the founding fathers and continues to serve as an essential component of our democratic process. It provides certainty, prevents regional polarization, encourages campaigning in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Therefore, I urge you to support the Electoral College and help preserve the integrity of our democratic system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

 I be write to express my opinion regard the Electoral College and to argue in favor of either keep the current system or change to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States after consider the information from various source include the text what be the Electoral College by the Office of the Federal Register the Indefensible Electoral College why even the well lay defense of the system be wrong by Bradford Plumer and in Defense of the Electoral College five reason to keep our despised method of choose the President by Judge Richard A. Posner I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral College be a crucial aspect of our democratic process and should be retain 

 firstly it be important to understand the purpose of the Electoral College as outline in the Constitution the found father establish it as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a direct popular vote Office of the Federal Register by do so they seek to ensure that both the will of the people and the interest of individual state be account for in the presidential election process 

 one of the major advantage of the Electoral College be the certainty it bring to the outcome of the election Judge Richard A. Posner since the win candidate 's share of the Electoral College invariably exceed their share of the popular vote dispute over the result be less likely in comparison to a direct popular vote system additionally the Electoral College ensure that a candidate must have broad regional appeal in order to secure the presidency Judge Richard A. Posner this prevent president from solely represent the interest of specific region and promote the idea of a president who be accountable to the entire nation 

 furthermore the Electoral College encourage candidate to focus their campaign effort on swing state which ensure that these state receive more attention and consideration from the candidate Judge Richard A. Posner this promote a fair and balanced electoral process in which voter in swing state play a crucial role in decide the outcome of the election 

 the system of winner take all allocation of electoral vote also offer an advantage to large state ensure that they receive more attention from presidential candidate during campaign Judge Richard A. Posner this be particularly important in balance out the disproportionate influence of small state due to the mal apportionment of the Senate as prescribe by the Constitution 

 while there be argument against the Electoral College such as the unfairness to voter in non swing state and the potential for a tie or disputed outcome the benefit of the current system outweigh these concern the Electoral College have stand the test of time ensure stability and representation within our democratic republic 

 in conclusion I strongly advocate for the retention of the Electoral College or consider change within the exist system such as proportional allocation of electoral vote while maintain the overall framework the Electoral College embrace the principle of the found father and continue to serve as an essential component of our democratic process it provide certainty prevent regional polarization encourage campaign in swing state balance the influence of large and small state and avoid the need for run off election therefore I urge you to support the Electoral College and help preserve the integrity of our democratic system 

 thank you for your attention to this matter

2099,1,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion about whether the United States should retain the Electoral College process or move towards a popular vote system to elect the president. Having immersed myself in multiple perspectives and arguments from different sources, I maintain that the Electoral College, despite its perceived faults, remains a crucial component of our political system and should be retained.

First and foremost, the Electoral College preserves the balance of power among states with different population sizes. As noted in the Office of the Federal Register's document, each state gets a number of electors proportional to their representation in Congress (What Is the Electoral College?). This assures that small states are not neglected and have their interests represented in the presidential election. In contrast, a popular vote system could result in candidates focusing primarily on densely populated areas, disregarding the diverse needs of smaller or rural states. 

Furthermore, Judge Richard A. Posner defends the Electoral College by emphasizing its contribution towards political stability in this country (In Defense of the Electoral College). He explains how the Electoral College demands that a presidential candidate has a broad appeal across numerous regions rather than focusing on sectional interests. This virtually ensures that the elected president represents a larger spectrum of the American populace, thereby adding to their legitimacy as the nation's leader.

Despite these arguments, valid concerns do exist about the current Electoral College system, as explored by Bradford Plumer (The Indefensible Electoral College). His remarks on potential election crises, such as electors not reflecting the people's will, or the possibility of an electoral tie, are significant. Yet, it's important to note that these scenarios are extraordinarily rare and have mechanisms in place for resolution. Moreover, the potential for distortions and dispute is not eliminated in a direct popular vote system – it might instead shift the battleground from state legislatures to individual precincts.

Regarding Plumer's concern that the current system unfairly forces candidates to focus on swing states, neglecting noncompetitive ones, Posner provides a compelling counter-argument (In Defense of the Electoral College). He explains that voters in these swing states, aware of their pivotal role, are more likely to scrutinize the candidates and their policies, fostering a more informed electorate – a foundation stone of any democracy.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College system is not perfect and may seem undemocratic when compared to a straightforward popular vote, it has provided us with political stability and encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Instead of abolishing it, I propose we analyze individual issues such as faithless electors or the winner-take-all system and initiate reforms to address these specific complaints. 

Thank you for considering my perspective.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]

1000,0,"Men are like ants. We are always in a rush and always desperate to arrive on time. The easiest way to arrive on time in any place, is by car. Cars, however, tend to do a lot more bad then they do good. Cars release large amounts of pollution and can raise smog and noise levels in areas where there is a lot of driving. Smog and pollution isn't very good for anybody, so some areas have taken preventative steps to keep Earth healthy and to keep people healthy as well. The shocking part is, the cars get cut out.

In some areas, like the experimental Vauban in Germany, cars are not allowed at all. No honking is heard when the sun rises, and streets are oddly empty. Shops are lined up within walking distance, and few buses run to allow for people to travel a little bit quicker. In fact, 70% of vaughn's population do not own cars, and many sold their cars for a chance to live in Vauban. The streets are safer, and people seem to be a lot less tense about things, when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun, an occupant of Vauban. Vauban has proved that removing the car entirely can help to calm people, and even redesign the way cities and homes work to provide safer, cleaner areas for man to live in.

Cars can need to be removed for more negative reason as well. Paris, France, had sever issues with the amount of smog in the city. Smog can be incredibly dangerous, making large chances of acid rain and possible issues with breathing. France has had one of the largest amounts of smog when compared to many other cities, usually only beat by Beijing, which in one of the most polluted areas. France knew, however, that the city could not possibly handle having every car taken away in a night, so they attempted to cut a half off for each day. For a week, fines were placed on cars with license plates that ended in either an even or odd number, the taxes applied more specifically to which license plates would be tagged, odd on one day, even the next. The large fines did not persuade everyone, however, and 4,000 driviers were still fined. The week of cutting down cars, however, proved to work very well and cut down on the amount of smog quickly and carefully so that everyone would have a safer and cleaner Paris.

In Bogota, Columbia, the removal of cars is celebrated as if it were a holiday. Each year on one day everyone will refrain from driving to skateboard, bike, walk, hike, or any number of modes of transportation to prevent the usage of cars. The city does this not only as a fun way to promote an ecofriendly Bogota, but to cut down on it's own smog issues. Like any capital of any country, there's a lot of movement, and with movement comes cars, and with cars: smog. Their event has even inpired many other cities and countries to do the same thing, continuously aiding in the fight against global warning.

Even America, the gasguzzling, NASCAR approving, roadrage warriors of the world, try to cut down on car usage. The issue has even reached the President. America has found that slowly but surely that men and women are slowly moving away from the car as a mode of transportation. Since 2005, car usage has dropped tremoendously in favour of public transportation like trams and buses.",0,"man be like ant we be always in a rush and always desperate to arrive on time the easy way to arrive on time in any place be by car car however tend to do a lot more bad then they do good car release large amount of pollution and can raise smog and noise level in area where there be a lot of driving Smog and pollution be n't very good for anybody so some area have take preventative step to keep Earth healthy and to keep people healthy as well the shocking part be the car get cut out

208,1,"Since our beautiful country was born we've always used the Electoral College system to elect our presidents. It's time that we modify this old rule and change it to the popular vote, because it's simply unfair to all the hardworking people that leave work early and have to wait in line for hours to fill out a little white paper. The Electoral does not allow for everyone's voice to be heard. Clearly, the Electoral college must change to the popular vote because of the winner take all method, & the confusion.

To begin with, the Electoral college is outdated because of the winner take all system. Even if the votes are off by one, whichever partygoers the most popular votes gets all of the electoral votes the United States are basically saying everybody else's voice that voted doesn't matter. This winner takes all system also deals with population, the bigger the state the more electoral votes. This ancient system is clearly stating the citizens of the smaller states votes do not matter. Although, the winner take all method induces the candidates to focus on the toss up states, it's still unfair to everyone.

In addition, the Electoral college is irrational because of all of the confusion and trust issues. Many of the citizens in our country don't even know what an electoral college is! Plus the fact that most people think they're voting for the president, but in reality they're voting for the slate of electors. It's also possible the electors that represent your party votes for the other candidate! Another major reason the Electoral college must be abolished is because the citizens do not even get to choose their very own electors! It's like buying a new car while being blindfolded and believing the dealer the car runs fine. Everyone's going to have skepticism so they should at least let the citizens choose their own electors. Then again, the Electoral college avoids run off elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral college was once a good idea for a starting country, but we now live in a elite dynasty that must have a few modifications on how the citizens elect their leader.",0,"since our beautiful country be bear we have always use the Electoral College system to elect our president it be time that we modify this old rule and change it to the popular vote because it be simply unfair to all the hardworke people that leave work early and have to wait in line for hour to fill out a little white paper the Electoral do not allow for everyone 's voice to be hear clearly the Electoral college must change to the popular vote because of the winner take all method the confusion

330,1,"Dear Mr. Senator, It has come to my, as well as many other's attention, that the presidential election is something that could potentially have disastrous outcomes. You, and many politicians like yourself, have been using a system called the Electoral College that people such as Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, and Jimmy Carter have been suggesting to demolish for years now. Personally, I find it quite alarming that although this process has been with us for all of this time, we have found the flaws yet still continue to take the risks. This is not simply about picking a president anymore, this is about the freedom of America.

All in all, the Electoral College at face value seems like a good idea for choosing a winner. It seems to make sense that we would choose electorss who the president trusts that would elect him president, but when you think about it, something feels rather off. First of all, the general public places their ballots in the appropriate box believing that they are voting for their ideal candidates. In reality, however, they are voting for their electorss instead. Most people who vote are unaware of this factor, and the lack of information pertaining to it is unsettling. Not only that, but the electorss are not chosen by the people. Does this not contradict ""By the people, for the people?"" Where exactly do these people fit in?

Furthermore, the electorss cannot always be trusted with voting for their respective candidates. This is something referred to as the disaster factor. While most who are picked by the candidate themself are trustworthy, electorss are people who are not in office, therefore may not be as trusting. Electors are an uncertain factor and in some complex cases, even two slates for electorss can be sent which could create a hectic mess. If you are going to vote for a president who you wish to win, and your vote goes to an electors that won't come through, it takes all of the power away from the people and places it right back into the state's hands.

Another thing to consider when pondering the validity of this process is the potential of a tie with electorsal voting. In this case, the election would be in the power of the House of Representatives, and the representatives from each state would decide the winner. We have had many opportunities for a tie during the elections, one even being the difference of 5,559 in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii. The problem with this is the loss of power within the nation. Once again, the people will no longer have a say in the voting and the energy it took them to decide on a candidate and go out to vote will be for virtually nothing. The people will no longer be represented. If something like this were to happen to our country, surely people from every state would be outraged.

Now, you may be thinking to yourself, why should I be worried? Sure, it is unlikely to get a tie in the electorsal votes. However, something as huge as deciding the leader of this country should not have even a single flaw in it. Horrible and unexpected things happen everyday, why couldn't we get a tie as well? Now, the main problem with getting rid of the Electoral College is the possibility of runoff elections. In defense of this, the Electoral College is the main reason that we have runoff elections in the first place. It prevents people in certain areas from voting because they feel as if they will have no say in the final result. Even if people still voted for the fun of it, it was only because of chance or political preference. With an election by popular vote, the chances of a runoff election would be significantly lower as people would realize the power they had in deciding it.

As you finish reading this, I ask you to consider all of the points I have made. I am certain that choosing to elect by popular vote would have more benefits than sticking to the old and flawed plan, the Electoral College. Endless proof points to the conclusion that this theory is correct, as the process of picking electorss to elect the president is redundant and confusing. Finally, with all of the things that could go wrong, using a new system would be one step forward in making our nation even greater.",0,"dear Mr. Senator it have come to my as well as many other 's attention that the presidential election be something that could potentially have disastrous outcome you and many politician like yourself have be use a system call the Electoral College that people such as Richard Nixon Bob Dole and Jimmy Carter have be suggest to demolish for year now personally I find it quite alarming that although this process have be with we for all of this time we have find the flaw yet still continue to take the risk this be not simply about pick a president anymore this be about the freedom of America

1684,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Cars have long been a symbol of freedom and convenience, but recent trends suggest that limiting car usage may actually have several advantages. Whether it is through car-free neighborhoods, driving bans, or car-free days, there are various strategies being implemented around the world to reduce the reliance on cars. This shift is not only beneficial for the environment but also for the overall well-being of communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars contribute significantly to global warming. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number goes up to 50 percent (Rosenthal, 2009). By reducing car usage, emissions can be significantly reduced, leading to cleaner air and a healthier planet.

Additionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion and reduce air pollution in urban areas. In Paris, a partial driving ban was implemented during a period of intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion (Duffer, 2014). Cities like Bogota, Colombia, have also experimented with car-free days, resulting in streets devoid of traffic jams and decreased smog levels (Selsky, 2002). By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, and walking, cities can improve traffic flow and create more livable spaces.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have positive effects on public health. Studies have shown that increased physical activity through modes of transportation such as biking or walking can lead to improvements in cardiovascular health and overall well-being (Rosenthal, 2013). Car-free neighborhoods, like Vauban in Germany, provide residents with the opportunity to walk or bike as the primary means of transportation, resulting in improved health outcomes and a stronger sense of community (Rosenthal, 2009).

Limiting car usage also promotes sustainable urban planning. By creating compact communities with accessible public transportation and less space for parking, cities can reduce urban sprawl and create more sustainable living environments. This approach has been adopted in places like Vauban, where stores are placed within walking distance on a main street instead of distant malls (Rosenthal, 2009). By designing communities that prioritize people over cars, cities can create vibrant, walkable, and socially connected neighborhoods.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to improving public health and promoting sustainable urban planning, the shift away from car dependence offers numerous benefits. By adopting strategies such as car-free neighborhoods, driving bans, and car-free days, societies can create more livable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly communities. It is clear that limiting car usage is no longer just a trend but a necessary step towards a more sustainable future.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

1099,1,"Even though the Electoral College is known as a disaster factor, it has its benefits. The Electoral College is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. Each candidate running in your state has his or her own group of electors that are voted for. When you vote on election day, which is held every four years on Tuesday after the first Monday in november, you vote for the candidate's electors. Many politicians wanted to abolish the Electoral College because of its lack of democratic pedigree, but the college doesn't allow voters of other regions to feel disenfranchised, it avoids runoff elections, and thinks that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal. It would not be fair for a candidate to campaign heavily in a state that they know they are going to win. This does not gain them any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows will win. This causes voters that are from the opposite region to feel as if their votes did not count, that their new president would not care about their interests or values. The president would not really be their president because of the fact that they were ignored.

Voters that are more likely to pay attention to the campaign by listening to each opposing sides that compete against one another should decide the election. If voters that voted didn't care and picked the weaker candidate, then everyone would pay the price. The knowledgable voters listen to the competing candidates and will receive the most information and attention from the candidates. This leads to a candidate worthy enough to become president, which will choose the country's decisions for the next four years.

Runoff elections, where elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast is avoided. There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, which complicates the presidential election process, but is reduced by the Electoral College to announce a clear winner. The runoff election once happened to Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992.

Many argue the fact that the Electoral College method may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state. People knowing their vote will have no effect, will have less intentions of paying attention to the election then they would have if the president picked the popular vote. Voter's in presidential elections are people who want to express a political reference and want the best for their country's future rather than people who think one vote may decide the election and disregard the point of voting.",0,"even though the Electoral College be know as a disaster factor it have its benefit the Electoral College be a process that consist of the selection of the elector each candidate run in your state have his or her own group of elector that be vote for when you vote on election day which be hold every four year on Tuesday after the first Monday in november you vote for the candidate 's elector many politician want to abolish the Electoral College because of its lack of democratic pedigree but the college do n't allow voter of other region to feel disenfranchise it avoid runoff election and think that the most thoughtful voter should be the one to decide the election

2011,0,"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: A Global Perspective

The advantages that accrue from limiting car usage in society are numerous and impactful. Consider, for instance, the case of Vauban, Germany, a suburban pioneer in the implementation of an almost entirely car-free zone. Abandoning the convenience of car ownership, despite the social and economic implications, 70 percent of Vauban residents do not own cars, thereby drastically reducing their carbon footprint (Rosenthal, Passage 1). Furthermore, less car usage has been associated with decreased tension and a happier lifestyle (Rosenthal). Thus, cutting down on car usage not only benefits the environment but also fosters a sense of community and serenity among residents.

Paris offers another prime example of the positive aspects associated with limiting car usage. The city implemented a partial driving ban in response to severe pollution, and the congestion was reduced by a whopping 60% (Duffer, Passage 2). In the light of this success, such measures can potentially be a practical response to mitigating pollution in cities across the globe. Greater implementation of such policies can lead to cleaner air and healthier lives for urban dwellers.

Moreover, the Day Without Cars program in Bogota, Colombia, saw large participation despite unfavorable weather conditions (Selsky, Passage 3). This initiative not only reduced smog but also promoted the use of alternative methods of transport. The residents' willingness to partake in this event underscores the buy-in from citizens when it comes to environmental preservation through reduced car usage. 

Finally, shifting attitudes, especially in the younger generations, are leading toward a decline in car ownership and driving in the United States (Rosenthal, Passage 4). This trend has positive implications for the overall reduction of carbon emissions. Should this trend continue, it could lead to a significant decrease in environmental pollution and an increase in ""mobilities,"" a rebranding by auto companies focused on broader product ranges beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, various initiatives and shifts in societal behavior emphasize the immense advantages of reducing car usage. These include environmental benefits, health and lifestyle improvements, changing attitudes, and industrial adaptations. As awareness increases, society at large needs to embrace these changes and actively participate in reducing car dependency for a greener and healthier future.",1,"title advantage of limit car usage A Global Perspective

1510,0,"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the positive effects of reducing car dependency in suburban areas. In Germany, the suburb of Vauban has implemented a car-free policy, where residents are not allowed to have vehicles except for two designated parking lots on the outskirts of the community. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. This has created a peaceful and less stressful environment, with verdant streets filled with bicycles and children instead of the noise and pollution of cars. Vauban is part of a larger movement called ""smart planning,"" which aims to separate suburban life from auto use. This approach is being adopted worldwide in an effort to make suburbs more compact, accessible to public transportation, and with reduced parking space.

In Paris, a driving ban was enforced due to severe smog caused by car emissions. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or face fines. This ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion in the city and highlighted the negative impact of car usage on air quality. Diesel fuel was specifically blamed for the smog, as France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. The ban in Paris demonstrates the need to promote alternative transportation and reduce reliance on cars, especially in heavily polluted areas.

Bogota, Colombia, has implemented an annual car-free day to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians participate by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work, leaving the streets empty of traffic. The success of this event has led other cities in Colombia and even neighboring countries to adopt similar initiatives. Bogota has also made significant improvements in its infrastructure, including the construction of extensive bicycle paths and the development of parks and sports centers, all aimed at reducing traffic congestion and creating a more sustainable city.

Evidence suggests that car usage in the United States may be on the decline. Recent studies indicate that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. The number of miles driven in the United States has dropped since 2005, even before the recession, and this decrease seems to be persisting even as the economy recovers. This could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. However, it could also have negative implications for the car industry. The rise of technologies such as the Internet, telecommuting, and cellphone apps has made it easier for people to connect without needing to drive. Cities are also prioritizing alternative modes of transportation, such as bike-sharing programs and car-sharing programs. Demographic shifts also indicate a decrease in car ownership among young people, while older generations are likely to retain their licenses as they age.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. Examples from around the world demonstrate the positive effects of reducing car dependency in suburban areas, improving air quality in polluted cities, and promoting alternative transportation options. The decline in car usage in the United States also has potential benefits for carbon emissions and the environment. By adopting smart planning principles, promoting alternative transportation, and investing in sustainable infrastructure, countries and cities can create a more livable and environmentally friendly future.",1,"limit car usage can have numerous advantage for both individual and the environment several example from around the world demonstrate the positive effect of reduce car dependency in suburban area in Germany the suburb of Vauban have implement a car free policy where resident be not allow to have vehicle except for two designate parking lot on the outskirt of the community as a result 70 percent of family in Vauban do not own car and 57 percent of resident sell their car to move there this have create a peaceful and less stressful environment with verdant street fill with bicycle and child instead of the noise and pollution of car Vauban be part of a large movement call smart planning which aim to separate suburban life from auto use this approach be be adopt worldwide in an effort to make suburb more compact accessible to public transportation and with reduce parking space

1618,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Limiting car usage is a growing trend in many parts of the world as cities and communities recognize the benefits of reducing dependency on cars. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on the ideas and information provided in the passages. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning, communities can improve their quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more accessible and sustainable environments.

Body Paragraph 1: Improved Quality of Life
One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in the overall quality of life. The German suburb of Vauban serves as a prime example, where 70 percent of families do not own cars (Passage 2). Residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and more relaxed (Passage 3). By reducing traffic congestion and noise levels, communities that limit car usage create a more peaceful and quiet environment. Additionally, walking and biking become more common, leading to improved physical health and well-being.

Body Paragraph 2: Environmental Benefits
Limiting car usage also has a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Passenger cars are responsible for a substantial portion of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to 50 percent in some areas of the United States (Passage 5). By decreasing reliance on cars, communities can help combat climate change and improve air quality, making them healthier and more sustainable for future generations. Paris enforced a partial driving ban during periods of high pollution, resulting in a significant drop in congestion and smog (Passage 14). Similar initiatives in Bogota, Colombia, have led to a car-free day, reducing traffic and promoting alternative transportation (Passage 21).

Body Paragraph 3: Efficient Land Use and Accessibility
By limiting car usage, communities can utilize their land more efficiently and create better accessibility. Vauban, for example, places stores within walking distance on the main street, reducing the need for malls along distant highways (Passage 6). This approach encourages people to walk or bike to nearby amenities, promoting a sense of community and reducing the need for excessive parking spaces. Additionally, this shift towards smart planning allows for the development of compact neighborhoods, making public transportation more accessible and reducing the dependence on private cars (Passage 6).

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage presents numerous advantages for communities. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning, cities and suburbs can improve their residents' quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more accessible and sustainable environments. With initiatives like car-free days and the promotion of public transportation, we can work towards a future where cars are no longer the linchpin of suburbs. It is essential for communities to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and prioritize the implementation of sustainable transportation solutions.",1,"title the advantage of limit car usage

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Preserving Democracy

Dear [State Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College has proven to be a vital process that ensures fair representation and stability within our democratic system. While some argue for a change towards a direct popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College safeguards against potential chaos and preserves the will of the people.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College often exceeds their share of the popular vote, resulting in a clear victory. The winner-take-all system in most states allows for a decisive electoral result, reducing the likelihood of disputes. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to close margins, recount requests, and potential challenges to the legitimacy of the election, as seen in the 2000 presidential election.

The Electoral College also ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election. Without the Electoral College, presidential candidates might focus solely on heavily populated urban areas and neglect the concerns of rural communities. The regional appeal requirement promotes a more balanced representation of interests and prevents a concentration of power in specific areas. This is crucial for maintaining a government that serves the needs of all citizens and prevents the disenfranchisement of certain states or regions.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns and interests of those states that can potentially swing the election. As Judge Posner points out, swing state voters are likely to be the most thoughtful and engaged, as they know their votes will have a significant impact on the final result. This focus on swing states fosters a more informed electorate and incentivizes candidates to address the concerns of a diverse range of voters.

The Electoral College also provides a balance between small and large states. Without this system, the political balance could tilt heavily in favor of large states at the expense of smaller states, as a result of the mal-apportionment of the Senate. The Electoral College ensures that candidates pay attention to small states and their unique concerns, which would otherwise be overshadowed by large population centers. This balance is essential in maintaining the integrity and equal representation of all states within our democratic system.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, which can complicate and prolong the electoral process. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College reliably produces a clear winner by awarding the candidate with the majority of electoral votes. This eliminates the need for additional rounds of voting and guarantees a definitive outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a crucial safeguard that upholds the principles of fairness, representation, and stability within our democracy. It promotes a balanced representation of regional interests, encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, provides a counterweight to the influence of large states, and ensures a clear winner without the need for run-off elections. While some argue for a direct popular vote, the Electoral College is a time-honored institution that has proven to be effective in preserving democratic values.

I urge you to consider these points and support the retention of the Electoral College. By doing so, we can uphold the integrity of our elections, promote fair representation, and safeguard the democratic principles upon which our nation was built.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving the interests of our state and our nation.

The problem with today's world is our lives revolve around cars to get us where we want to be and they have become a status symbol for many. The thought of being without a car scares most people, but limiting car usage is becoming more popular in cities, and has shown many advantages in the environment and in the communities. For example, the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars completely Rosenthal. On the otherhand, Paris, France banded driving due to smogonly odd license plates could drive one day and even numbered plates could drive the next day Duffer. Many advantages came with limiting driving in these cities such as, less air pollution from tailpipe, congestion lessened, and introduced alternative ways of transportation into different communities.

""Passenger cars are 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the Unites States"" Rosenthal. This means if car usage was limited than we could cut back on almost 50 percent of our pollution in the United States. ""Transportation is the second largest source for America's emissions"" Rosenthal. The limiting of car usage would also help and knock down cars as being the second biggest emissions source in the U.S. Without so much air pollution in the United States we could live healthier and better lives. We would be able to reduce global warming if we reduce the amount of driving we do.

Another advantage with limiting car usage would be the decrease in congestion around our city and towns. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog"" Duffer. This means that traffic would die down as well, there would be no more rush hour after work, and the roads would be safer because there would be less people driving on them.

Lastly, limiting car usage would bring people to find alternative and healthier ways to get to where they need to be. In Bogota, Colombia every year for one day millions of people bike, skateboard, or take public transport to get where they want to be Selsky. With people using alternative ways to get to work it would not only benefit the environment as well as benefiting their health.

The answer is clear, we need to limit the usage of cars in America. Other countries are doing it and now is our time to jump on board with the movement of less car movement.

1338,1,"Dear Senator, The electoral college has existed for many years till now and has been used to elect the presidents of the United States of America, clearly this form of electing a president is outdated. Senator, You must change the electoral college and replace it with popular vote because the electoral college is unfair, and irrational.

Senator you must change the electoral college and replace it with popular vote because it is unfair. This is true because under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a state senator who in turn elects the president. For example a person living in Texas that wanted to vote for John Kerry would have to vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would then receive his 34 electoral votes. Because of this system voters cant control who the electors vote for, and sometimes voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The electoral college isn only unfair to the voters but also to the men and women who are competing in the elections, for example in the 2000 U.S presidential race Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gores 266 electoral votes. This is why you must replace the electoral college Mr. Senator.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is irrational to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on swing states. Seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign add. the electoral college is irrational because given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house of representatives can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people, and if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this senator in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election, in 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophie. This is why you must replace the electoral college due to its irrationalism.

Its quite clear State senator, the electoral college is unfair and irrational, the best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. and the arguements against direct elections are spurious at best. This is why you must abolish the electoral college.",0,"dear Senator the electoral college have exist for many year till now and have be use to elect the president of the United States of America clearly this form of elect a president be outdate Senator you must change the electoral college and replace it with popular vote because the electoral college be unfair and irrational

1289,0,"The era of mass car usage is slowly coming to an end. Many countries around the world are implementing innovative methods of limiting car usage in their country. Although a car may seem like the logical and easier way for one to get around, there are many other less costly, and better for the environment methods of transportation. It is crucial to the future of the environment for the world to act now and use less cars. Cars produce emissions that are very bad for the ozone. If the ozone tears, radiation from the sun will penetrate the atmosphere and severely damage the earth in which so many life forces thrive. There are countless advantages of limiting car usage that would benefit all the world in the longhaul.

New communities are rising all over the globe where car usage is severely limited and all residents are pedestrians. It may seem like a dysfunctional community but the residents actually feel to the contrary. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" without the use of cars, residents and their families feel much more content. All the resources they need are within the community and definently within walking or biking distance. This is just one of many progressive ideas that has proved successful and very beneficial.

In other cities where pollution is very high, bans on car usage are coming into place very well. Citizens are discouraged by law to operate personal forms of transportation on certain days. This came into place in Paris after the whole city was drowned in smog. Smog is the pollution exerted from cars and mixed with fog. Although some people did break the law to use their car, it worked for the most part. Many people do not realize the the effect pollution has on the environment until they are able to see physical change. That is why the world must act now before physical change can be seen globaly.

355,0,"To all my fellow citizens, I must tell you about all the spectacular things cities are doing. They have started giving up their cars to decrease the congestion and pollution rate. The cities that have already tried it have seen a huge benefit.

A little community in Vauban, Germany was the fist city to let go of their cars. Residents say they feel much less stress than when they had cars. What a surprise that not having to worry about traffic would reduce stress. It has also drastically reduced tailpipe emissions. They're have been rearangments by stores, they have been relocated along public sidewalks so that people no longer hae to drive across town to the mall or stores. They can simply walk or bike down the road to pick up whatever might interest them.

The next place that picked up this amazing wonderful idea was none other than the busiest city in France Paris. Paris ordered its citizens to leave their car at home, and if they didn't comply would pay a 22euro fine. 4000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to this fine, but if I was able to buy a car and not drive then I would be among those who would have their car impounded. On the bright side congestion went down 60% which is amazing for one of the busiest cities in the world.

The next place thats wanting to pick up this no car trend is none other than right here in the United States, and were supporting it. Each year that goes by recent studies have suggest that Americans aren't buying as many cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. If this pattern progresses it could solve our atmosphere problem. If huge cities and like Paris,Vauban,and The United States will give up cars. Than that alone could drastically change the path that our planet is headed for.

So citizens I hope this encourages you to cut back on your car usage. Take the bike out every once and a while or just walk. Whats the worst that could happen if you limited your automobile usage.",0,"to all my fellow citizen I must tell you about all the spectacular thing city be do they have start give up their car to decrease the congestion and pollution rate the city that have already try it have see a huge benefit 

 a little community in Vauban Germany be the fist city to let go of their car resident say they feel much less stress than when they have car what a surprise that not have to worry about traffic would reduce stress it have also drastically reduce tailpipe emission they be have be rearangment by store they have be relocate along public sidewalk so that people no long hae to drive across town to the mall or store they can simply walk or bike down the road to pick up whatever might interest they 

 the next place that pick up this amazing wonderful idea be none other than the busy city in France Paris Paris order its citizen to leave their car at home and if they did n't comply would pay a 22euro fine 4000 driver be fine and 27 people have their car impound for their reaction to this fine but if I be able to buy a car and not drive then I would be among those who would have their car impound on the bright side congestion go down 60 which be amazing for one of the busy city in the world 

 the next place that s want to pick up this no car trend be none other than right here in the United States and be support it each year that go by recent study have suggest that Americans be n't buy as many car drive less and get few license if this pattern progress it could solve our atmosphere problem if huge city and like Paris Vauban and the United States will give up car than that alone could drastically change the path that our planet be head for

291,0,"Recent trends are showing that the average person is trading in their keys for a more contemporary mode of transportation, such as public transit or walking and biking from point A to point B. Even though the reason as to why this is occurring has yet to become clear, there are some general benefits that are known to come from this. More and more, cities in developed and developing nations are now being planned to be more dense, so that the citizens in them can get to where they need to be, without needing a car. Because of this, fewer greenhouse emissions are being created, there is less congestion and smog in cities, and the burden of traffic is being lifted from the everyday driver. The more this trend continues, the more beneficial it can become.

Climate change is a ubiquitous threat to the world. In order to face and reverse the direction of where the world is heading, some cities are finding new ways to face this issue. For example, a city in Germany has practically given up cars through its policies and design. Citizens are only allowed two places to park, and the city is designed so that everything you need is within a walking or biking distance, albeit more dense. More and more places are slowly beginning to adopt this style of suburb because ""emissions from an increasing middle class are choking cities"" source 1. Making this change will not be easy, but it is important because ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent ... in the United States"" source 1.

Another issue that weighs down cities everywhere is the horrid smog and unbearable congestion most cities face. In order to combat this adverse effect of driving, Paris has banned driving in efforts to reduce the smog it deals with. The effort proved to create a temporary solution, as ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog"" source 2. A city in Bogota, Columbia has taken a day off from driving, and the results were so positive that the movement has spread to multiple cities in neighboring countries. This movement ""left the street eerily devoid of traffic jams"" source 3.

In an ever changing world that exists today with cities that never sleep, the average person is constantly burdened and stressed by things that tend to pile up. So why have driving and traffic be added to that heap of annoyance, especially if it's avoidable? The fact is, driving can be incredibly stressful and sometimes border on superfluous. A resident of the densely populated german town where 70 percent of its citizens don't own cars claimed, ""when I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"", referring to how they no longer need to own a car or drive source 1. The day of no driving in Bogota, Columbia has been said to be""a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" source 3.

Modern nations have revolved heavily on the invention and continuous innovation of the automobile. However, the increasing dependence on this mode of transportation has created some adverse affects for the general population of the world. In order to solve this problem, an emphasis on cleaner and more efficient modes of transportation must occur, along with more densely designed, modern cities. A larger independence from cars can create fewer greenhouse emissions, cause less congestion and smog in cities, and make the average citizen free from the stress of driving.",0,"recent trend be show that the average person be trade in their key for a more contemporary mode of transportation such as public transit or walk and bike from point a to point B. even though the reason as to why this be occur have yet to become clear there be some general benefit that be know to come from this More and more city in developed and develop nation be now be plan to be more dense so that the citizen in they can get to where they need to be without need a car because of this few greenhouse emission be be create there be less congestion and smog in city and the burden of traffic be be lift from the everyday driver the more this trend continue the more beneficial it can become

1062,1,"The presidential Elections.

The elections are a brutal time candidates compete for the favor of the citizens they campaign, give great speeches about why they would be best for the position of leading the nation, often state why their adversary would be the worst person for the job. This causes opposition in the nation tearing it apart, however now not only are the people emotional about the election but also about the process, their are aguments about whether or not that the original process would remain. The system that the elections have been held since the Constitution has been written was that each citizen in a state would vote for one candidate or the other by voting for the electors of that specific person then the electors in turn would vote for the candidate and their votes would decide the presidency as stated in paragraph six and seven of the first source"" What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register.

This presents the system to be truly flawed in the way that it is currently operating.

One of the reasons the electoral college must stay is that the will be a certainty of the outcomes, they will know exacty what will be coming out as a result instead of being uncertain for examplesource 1 Obama recived 6.1 percent from the electoral vote and 51.3 percent for the poplar votes.

201,0,"The using of cars has caused much of the worlds green house gas imitions, in America as much as 50% of the imitions are caused souly by transportation. Many people feel that this is destroying our atmosphere and that we should cut down on imitions by walking, biking or car pooling. Efforts to cut down keep our atmosphere clean and breathable. Some communities such as Vauban, Germany have illuminated car use entirely.

Vauban is a new experimental suburb where there is no street parking or driveways and the only place to park is in a garage where you must buy a space for 40,000 which has cut the car ownership rate down to only about 30%. There are as many as 5,500 residents in Vauban and most of them say they like it much better without having to worry about a car. In many suburbs however the houses are much to far apart for them to be carfree, though many areas are considering developments like this one so they can clean up the air.

Other cities, such as Paris, are forced to ban driving for days at a time in order to clear the thick smog that hovers above the city. On one day odd numbered plates won't be allowed to drive and on the next day even, volaters are fined 31. As many as 4,000 drivers are fined. Only once the smog was sufficiently cleared did they allow both plate types to drive. Limiting driving can prevent problems like this from occurring in all cities.

In Colombia they have a day where all cars are banned, chalanging the inhabitance to find alternate routs of travel for fear of the 25 fine for violators. The day without cars began in the mid1990's for Bogota, a city with a population of 7 million, has participated, but last year two other cities in Colombia joined in. Dispite the rainy weather many people still hiked or rode their bikes. Many citizens say that it keeps the cities air clear and that its nice to have a day without traffic jams filling the streets. The Day without cars is an event that many countries hope to adopt.

Studies show that many people from the newest generation aren't bothering to get a licence. Cell phones and apps make car pooling easy and the internet allows you to interact with friends without having to drive to visit them. Experts are hoping this trend will continue and that it will cut down the gas imitions. With increased use of social networking technology hopefully people will also become more aware of how they are affecting their planet and move to help others cut down as well.",0,"the using of car have cause much of the world green house gas imition in America as much as 50 of the imition be cause souly by transportation many people feel that this be destroy our atmosphere and that we should cut down on imition by walk biking or car pooling effort to cut down keep our atmosphere clean and breathable some community such as Vauban Germany have illuminate car use entirely

789,0,"Imagine that it's 6:00am, Monday 2026 and you wake up to the smell of gasoline, fuel, and fogged air you look outside and all you see is car after car commuting to one's everyday life and spreading pollution every where. Cars are used way to often by many people who don't even need it most the time. If you do your part and limit car usage only good things will come to the world. Limiting car usage in today's environment sounds like a difficult thing to do since people work, go to school, etc. but in reality limiting car usage is saving the environment around us and by saving the environment you are saving yourself.

The high number of car usage is polluting our environment in numerous ways due to the smog it creates that corrupts the air. Sometimes it takes seeing what one is doing to stop and think about how they are affecting it. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city Source 2, Paragraph 10"". You can see that because of the increased pollution in Paris they putforth a law to limit the car usage in the city. If you limit usage than progress in the environment will occur. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog Source 2, Paragraph 14"". In only ""fivedays"" more than half of congested pollution decreased due to the limiting of car usage in that area. Cars can just destroy the atmosphere but we as people can make a big change by just walking or riding a bike in the times where you don't need a car and just doing that is a great way to decrease pollution by limiting your car usage.

Some places and people in the world seem to thrive without cars in their everyday system. People who don't own cars seem to have less stress in their life. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way... Source 1, Paragraph 3"". In some areas of the world the government has days to support the limiting of car usage by banning them for a temporary time. ""BOGOTA, Colombia In a program... millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Source 3, Paragraph 20"". Having a day free of cars has a great chance of decreasing some of the modern stresses of life. Living a life without cars even if it is for a certain period of time is helpful in reducing the pressure on ones' life and gives nature a fighting chance on this planet.

Limiting car usage is beneficial to world whether the impact is small or large it all plays a good part in protecting our health and the environment around us. People have made changes some take to the extreme others don't do something about it until they see for themselves what it does.

1432,1,"I am writing to express my perspective on the ongoing debate regarding the Electoral College and the possibility of transitioning to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. This issue is of great importance to our democratic process, and I believe that careful consideration is necessary before making any significant changes.

The Electoral College has been a longstanding institution in our electoral system, with its roots traced back to the framers of the Constitution. One of the key arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College is that it ensures a fair representation of diverse interests across states. This system prevents densely populated urban areas from overshadowing the concerns and needs of less populous rural regions. By allocating electoral votes based on the number of congressional representatives and senators, the Electoral College balances the influence of states with varying populations.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes stability and prevents the concentration of power in a few populous states. Critics of a popular vote system argue that it could lead to candidates focusing solely on major cities or densely populated regions, neglecting the concerns and issues of citizens in less populated areas. The Electoral College encourages candidates to consider the needs of a broad range of constituents, fostering a more comprehensive and representative approach to governance.

While the current system has its merits, I understand the concerns raised by those advocating for a shift to a popular vote. Critics argue that the winner-takes-all approach in most states can lead to a disregard for minority voices within those states. Additionally, instances of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the electoral vote, as seen in some recent elections, have sparked calls for reform.

However, it's crucial to recognize that the Electoral College's flaws may not be solved by a simple switch to a popular vote. Both systems have their advantages and drawbacks, and a comprehensive reform effort should be undertaken with careful consideration of the potential consequences. Perhaps a hybrid model or modifications to the current system could address the concerns without sacrificing the benefits provided by the Electoral College.

In conclusion, the debate over the Electoral College versus a popular vote system is a complex and multifaceted issue. While the Electoral College has its flaws, it serves as a safeguard against the tyranny of the majority and ensures that the interests of all states are considered. Any decision to change our electoral system should be approached with caution, considering the potential consequences and exploring alternative solutions.

Thank you for your time and consideration of these important matters.

Subject: The Benefits of Keeping the Electoral College
 
Dear [Senator’s Name],
 
I am writing to you today to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in place for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves important purposes and should be preserved. In this letter, I will present arguments in favor of the Electoral College system, drawing evidence from various sources.
 
One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Judge Richard A. Posner argues that disputes over electoral votes are less likely to occur than disputes over the popular vote. He states that because the winner-take-all system is used in most states, even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide victory in the electoral vote for that state (Posner, 2012). This system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote exceeds their share of the national popular vote, reducing the likelihood of contested election results.
 
Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the concept of a president who represents the entire nation. As Judge Posner suggests, a presidential candidate must have broad trans-regional appeal to win the electoral vote. This prevents a candidate with only regional support from being elected and ensures that the president will be accountable to the interests of people from all regions of the country (Posner, 2012).
 
Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign across different states, including swing states. Bradford Plumer points out that candidates tend to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain (Plumer, 2008). This means that voters in swing states receive more attention from candidates and may be more informed and thoughtful in their voting decisions. In turn, this ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who are well-informed about the candidates and their policies, have a greater influence in deciding the election.
 
Moreover, the Electoral College system balances the weight of large states against smaller states, addressing the potential imbalance created by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Judge Posner argues that the Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates because winning by a similar margin in a large state yields more electoral votes than in a small state (Posner, 2012). This allows candidates to address the concerns and interests of both large and small states, preventing an imbalance in representation.
 
Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections can complicate the election process. Posner (2012) highlights that the Electoral College method selects a clear winner, even if the popular vote results in a plurality. This ensures a more straightforward and conclusive outcome, reducing the uncertainty and potential for prolonged election disputes.
 
In conclusion, the Electoral College serves important functions that benefit the nation as a whole. It provides certainty in election outcomes, ensures that the president represents the entire country, encourages candidates to campaign in diverse states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While some argue for a popular vote system, the Electoral College remains a crucial component of our democratic system. I strongly recommend preserving the Electoral College to maintain its numerous benefits.
 
Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I hope that you will take these arguments into account as you make decisions regarding the future of our presidential election system.

 Dear Senator ’s name 
 
 I be write to you today to express my support for keep the Electoral College in place for the election of the President of the United States while many argue in favor of change to a popular vote system I believe that the Electoral College serve important purpose and should be preserve in this letter I will present argument in favor of the Electoral College system draw evidence from various source 
 
 one of the primary advantage of the Electoral College be the certainty it provide regard the outcome of the presidential election Judge Richard A. Posner argue that dispute over electoral vote be less likely to occur than dispute over the popular vote he state that because the winner take all system be use in most state even a slight plurality in a state lead to a landslide victory in the electoral vote for that state Posner 2012 this system ensure that the win candidate 's share of the electoral vote exceed their share of the national popular vote reduce the likelihood of contested election result 
 
 furthermore the Electoral College promote the concept of a president who represent the entire nation as Judge Posner suggest a presidential candidate must have broad trans regional appeal to win the electoral vote this prevent a candidate with only regional support from be elect and ensure that the president will be accountable to the interest of people from all region of the country Posner 2012 
 
 another advantage of the Electoral College be that it encourage candidate to campaign across different state include swing state Bradford Plumer point out that candidate tend to focus their campaign effort on swing state where the outcome of the election be uncertain Plumer 2008 this mean that voter in swing state receive more attention from candidate and may be more informed and thoughtful in their voting decision in turn this ensure that the most thoughtful voter who be well informed about the candidate and their policy have a great influence in decide the election 
 
 moreover the Electoral College system balance the weight of large state against small state address the potential imbalance create by the mal apportionment of the Senate Judge Posner argue that the Electoral College give large state more attention from presidential candidate because win by a similar margin in a large state yield more electoral vote than in a small state Posner 2012 this allow candidate to address the concern and interest of both large and small state prevent an imbalance in representation 
 
 lastly the Electoral College eliminate the need for run off election in case where no candidate receive a majority of the popular vote run off election can complicate the election process posner 2012 highlight that the Electoral College method select a clear winner even if the popular vote result in a plurality this ensure a more straightforward and conclusive outcome reduce the uncertainty and potential for prolonged election dispute 
 
 in conclusion the Electoral College serve important function that benefit the nation as a whole it provide certainty in election outcome ensure that the president represent the entire country encourage candidate to campaign in diverse state balance the influence of large and small state and avoid the need for run off election while some argue for a popular vote system the Electoral College remain a crucial component of our democratic system I strongly recommend preserve the Electoral College to maintain its numerous benefit

827,0,"There is a growing movement in lots of western countries to do less driving. In Bogota, the capital city of Colombia, a ""Day Without Cars"" has been established. It is an annual event where residents of the city are banned from using cars, and violators are fined. In Paris, residents were banned from using their vehicles for about week due to toxic emmisions, widely blamed on diesel fuel. In Germany, a development neighborhood called Vauban was created and has a strict policy on parkingg. Carsized garages, and street parking are banned, requiring residents to pay an extra 40000 dollars to purchase a parkingg space in the neighborhood. These ideals are even spreading to America.

Driving will emit toxins into the air, called greenhouse gases. These gases rise into the air, but are trapped by the ozone layer into our atmosphere and make the Earth warmer. This is a bad thing because the Arctic will start to melt and sea levels would rise. Now, vehicles are not the sole cause of this epidemic, but they are a large contributor. In Beijing, China it is said to be so polluted due to tailpipe emmisions that one would get sick if they were to go outside without a mask on to stop from breathing in the chemicals. In Paris, France the airborne toxins reached to a level just under the amount of chemicals in the air of Beijing. The city officials of Paris had to ban use of automobiles for about a week to rid the air of the poisons. If caught, violators were fined 22 euros 31 dollars American. This worked surprisingly well, and since the air cleared up, people are allowed to use their cars again. The Vauban in Germany is a neighborhood that has made it extremely difficult to own a vehicle. While vehicle ownership is permitted, carsized garages are not included in the homes, and parkingg on the street is prohibited. If a resident wishes to park their vehicles, they must spend 40000 extra dollars along with the house for a space in a large garage at the edge of the development. This has all lead to cleaner air and happier, healthier people.

It is a well known fact the walking and cycling helps a person stay in shape. It keeps the heart flowing regularly, helps keep the lungs exercised, and keeps leg muscles strong ad healthy. If these ways of transportation are exhibited more often, and vehicles used less, we will not only have cleaner air, but a healthier human population. Walking can also help the brain work with the body to relieve stress, which puts people at less of a risk for heart disease. These factors are essential to producing a healthier population, which could let people live longer, and encourage them to do meaningful things that could benefit other parts of the world. The Internet has also been helpful in keeping people connected with friends and lovedones without the need of driving to see them. It is possible to to center where you live around places to buy food and necessary supplies, as well as close to your workplace, all in walking distance. Even if that is not possible, finding a bus or public transportation route is always an option. It is less expensive than gasoline tax included, car insurance, and any other expenses that might come with a privatlyowned vehicle. It is also less likely to get into an autoaccident when using public transportaion, and if it does happen it is not your responsibility to pay for the insurance deductible. All these factors and alternative transportaion methods can help to improve life for all people than it is with so many privatelyowned vehicles.

The private owning of vehicles is convienient, but is still a hazard to the genearal health of our population. It poisons the air, and gives people an excuse to not walk or ride their bycyles as much, which can diminish their physical health. If we start to use privately owned vehicles less, however, it will promote the general welfare of our people. It is possible to cut the use of these vehicles short and preserve, even raise, our standards of living.",0,"there be a grow movement in lot of western country to do less driving in Bogota the capital city of Colombia a Day without car have be establish it be an annual event where resident of the city be ban from use car and violator be fine in Paris resident be ban from use their vehicle for about week due to toxic emmision widely blame on diesel fuel in Germany a development neighborhood call Vauban be create and have a strict policy on parkingg Carsized garage and street parking be ban require resident to pay an extra 40000 dollar to purchase a parkingg space in the neighborhood these ideal be even spread to America

757,1,"Dear Senator, I believe that the United States deserves someone who will lead this country to do the right thing, to make independent choices, and to be the best version of ourselves we can be every day. Now, how do we know when choosing a leader to represent us if thats what we will achieve when voting? We don't for sure, but we can make judgements and calls that will give us a better understanding to whom we are choosing. One of the biggest fought over rights was the right to vote, in which everyone wanted. Now that we have that vote, we should be able to use that freedom and have a say in who we want to represent us. Therefore, I think we should change the election to popular vote for the President of the United States rather than relying on the Electoral College.

The Electoral college consists of 538 Electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party and given their own says and responsibilities. That being said, I think that getting rid of the Electoral College will eliminate all biased decisions and will create more freedom and responsibilities for the people of the U.S. to use their own judgement and choose who they think will best represent the country. Being in the electoral college and being selected to have a heavy say in who will be chosen is a big responsibilty and in that responsibility are duties to not only look at each candidate with one mind set and one point of view but to make an unbiased judgement. To make an unbiased call would mean to put away all your own thoughts and judgements and really get a good understanding of who the people truly need. Back in 1960, it states that segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. How can we tell that something like this will not happen again? Well if we choose to keep the Electoral College it very well could and the people of the country would not be making decisions for themselves as well.

Most worrying comes from the fear of a tie, in which the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one single vote. That single vote from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters could have as much say as the 55 representatives from California who represent 35 million voters. So therefore the election is really only a few swing voters away from a disaster. Because of the winnertakeall system, candidates really dont spend time campaigning in states they think they have no chance of winning, really only focusing on the bigger states with more votes. This is also unfair because then the people with the right to vote do not get a say in who they want to represent their country. The Electoral college really takes away many rights and freedoms to the people of the U.S. and doesnt give us the chance to have a say. Studies even show that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now!

As well as having such a biased voting system, this is such an unfair system due to the fact the the popular vote winner could loose because of the Electoral College voters. This would be a very bad decision to keep the Electoral College especially if these Electoral voters have had their decision swayed by something. Then we will have a president that is only the president because of some voters biased and unfair judgemented calls. If one Electoral College voter has a certain view on a candidate, they could very well share that and somehow persuade the other voters decisions due to one persons thoughts and points of view on the candidate. One person can easily influence many peoples own judgements, which would cause them to choose poorly and only go under the pressure of that persons thoughts. The Electoral College has so many cons which would make it such a bad decision to keep this system and go by a biased and unfair advantage. So I believe that the best thing for the U.S. voting system would be to abolish the Electoral College and to keep the popular vote system so that everyone has their own say on who will achieve great things for our country.",0,"dear Senator I believe that the United States deserve someone who will lead this country to do the right thing to make independent choice and to be the good version of ourselves we can be every day now how do we know when choose a leader to represent we if that s what we will achieve when vote we do n't for sure but we can make judgement and call that will give we a well understanding to whom we be choose one of the big fight over right be the right to vote in which everyone want now that we have that vote we should be able to use that freedom and have a say in who we want to represent we therefore I think we should change the election to popular vote for the President of the United States rather than rely on the Electoral College

54,1,"Dear Rick Scott, Controversial. This is the word that can describe the Electoral College in recent elections. The Electoral College is composed of 538 votes, a presidential candidate must acquire 270 to win the election. States with large populations get more electoral votes so say, Rhode Island. California gets 55 votes while the puny Rhode Island gets a whopping 3 votes. The Electoral College has been debated since the 2000 election, where Al Gore lost even though he got more popularity votes. Many folks believe the Electoral College should be abolished. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in the presidential elections, because it shows a clear winner, it ensures it is, ""Everyone's President"", educated voters count in the swing states and it avoids RunOff Elections.

Without the Electoral College, some elections may be hard to decide a true winner. No matter the situation, the Electoral College will determine a winner, if the popular vote and electoral vote become tied, which is highly unlikely, the vote will be taken to the senate. Each senator counts as one vote, so no longer do bi states matter. Also, the Electoral College ensures the presidential candidates have transregional appeal. It makes the votes count, the president chose is surely, ""Everyone's President,"" rather than a favorite in just northeastern states. Furthermore, swing states are tremendously important to the outcome of the election. States such as Florida, New York, Texas and California have dozens of votes combined, winning all four of those states pretty much means presidency. The swing states not only have more electoral votes because of population, but because of their voters. On average, there are more educated voters in the swing states, they actually stay up to date, watch the news and know the means of each candidate. The Electoral College also avoids the disaster of which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. A good example of this is when Clinton had only 43% of the popular votes won, yet he got a whopping 370 electoral votes, which made him president. The pressure of having a runoff election is nearly vanished by the Electoral College. Although others say that the Electoral College should be abolished, because in that system, voters vote a slate of electors, not the president. Well tough , the Electoral College ensures a winner, and that is all that matters.

The Electoral College should, for sure, be kept in the Presidential Election system. It consists of 538 total votes, and 270 votes have to go to a candidate to pick a winner. Although the votes may tie up, which is nearly impossible, the Electoral College ensures another method to decide the presidency. The Electoral College produces a sure winner, ""Everyone's President,"" is elected, educated voters are in the swing states and it avoids the disaster of a RunOff Election.",0,"Dear Rick Scott Controversial this be the word that can describe the Electoral College in recent election the Electoral College be compose of 538 vote a presidential candidate must acquire 270 to win the election state with large population get more electoral vote so say Rhode Island California get 55 vote while the puny Rhode Island get a whopping 3 vote the Electoral College have be debate since the 2000 election where Al Gore lose even though he get more popularity vote many folk believe the Electoral College should be abolish I believe that the Electoral College should be keep in the presidential election because it show a clear winner it ensure it be everyone 's President educate voter count in the swing state and it avoid RunOff Elections

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has its advantages and should be retained.

One of the strengths of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of the presidential election. As stated in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the election results are more decisive and less likely to be disputed compared to a popular vote system. In instances where there is a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, the election is thrown to the House of Representatives, ensuring that a clear winner is determined.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president is representative of all regions of the country. As Judge Posner explains, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This encourages presidential candidates to campaign in different states, rather than focusing solely on populous areas. This way, candidates must appeal to a diverse range of voters and address the concerns of various regions. This keeps the president accountable to the interests of the entire nation, rather than just a few heavily populated areas.

The system of swing states, which is inherent in the Electoral College, also has its advantages. In ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" Judge Posner argues that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on closely contested states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information from the candidates, making them more informed and engaged in the election process. These swing states often represent a diverse cross-section of the population, ensuring that the president is responsive to a wide range of viewpoints and concerns.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it restores some balance to the political power of large and small states. Judge Posner explains that the mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states less political weight. By awarding electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College gives larger states more attention in presidential campaigns. This ensures that the interests and concerns of both large and small states are taken into account during elections.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, as explained by Judge Posner. This prevents complications and delays in the election process. It also ensures that a clear winner is determined, even if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This helps maintain confidence in the election results and prevents prolonged political uncertainty.

While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College system, such as the argument that it may discourage some voters in ""sure-win"" states from participating, the benefits of the system outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College provides stability, representation, and accountability in the election process.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College when considering any potential changes to the presidential election system. It is clear that this system has its merits and has served our country well for centuries. I believe that preserving the Electoral College will uphold the principles on which our democracy was founded.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I look forward to your continued dedication to serving the best interests of our state and our nation.

1573,0,"In recent years, there has been a growing trend in limiting car usage in various cities around the world. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative forms of transportation. The advantages of limiting car usage are evident in the experiences of communities like Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia.

Vauban, an experimental community in Germany, has implemented strict regulations on car ownership and parking. While car ownership is allowed, residents are only permitted to park in large garages at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. The absence of cars has created a peaceful and serene environment, with streets filled only with bicycles and pedestrians. This has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, as automobiles are responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe.

Similarly, Paris has enforced driving bans during periods of intense smog to reduce pollution levels. In these instances, only cars with even- or odd-numbered license plates were allowed on the roads, with violators facing fines. This partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion in the city. The high turnout and success of these restrictions demonstrate that limiting car usage can have a positive impact on air quality and public health.

In Bogota, Colombia, millions of residents participate in a car-free day each year. Cars are completely banned on this day, with only buses and taxis permitted. The goal of this event is to promote alternative forms of transportation and reduce smog. The success of this program has led to the expansion of car-free days to other cities in Colombia. Municipal authorities from other countries have also come to Bogota to observe and learn from this revolutionary movement.

Limiting car usage has several benefits for the environment and society as a whole. The reduction in car ownership and driving has the potential to significantly decrease carbon emissions, making a positive impact on global climate change. Additionally, car-free communities can reduce congestion and improve air quality, leading to healthier and more sustainable cities. The shift towards alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, can also bring a sense of community and connectedness among residents.

While the cultural shift away from car dependency may have implications for the car industry, it presents significant opportunities for urban planning and the development of innovative transportation solutions. The trend of limiting car usage is not limited to developed countries; it is also observed in the developing world, where burgeoning middle-class populations are contributing to increased air pollution in cities. Governments and organizations around the world are starting to recognize the importance of limiting car usage and promoting sustainable transportation options. Through these efforts, we can create more livable, environmentally-friendly, and efficient cities for future generations.",1,"in recent year there have be a grow trend in limit car usage in various city around the world this movement know as smart planning aim to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emission and promote alternative form of transportation the advantage of limit car usage be evident in the experience of community like Vauban in Germany Paris in France and Bogota in Colombia

 while the cultural shift away from car dependency may have implication for the car industry it present significant opportunity for urban planning and the development of innovative transportation solution the trend of limit car usage be not limit to develop country it be also observe in the develop world where burgeon middle class population be contribute to increase air pollution in city government and organization around the world be start to recognize the importance of limit car usage and promote sustainable transportation option through these effort we can create more livable environmentally friendly and efficient city for future generation"
599,1,"Dear State Senator, 12315 I have a very strongly worded, persuasive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways president's become elected, but it's serving an injustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College.I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished.

My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in. What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, ""Most states have a ""winner take all"" system that awards electors to the winning presidential candidate."" The winner take all system is not a fair way to elect a president because of its biases. The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largly populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to california or Texas because those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campaign for a certain candidates. According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No reigon has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candiadtes focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College.

My second reason of why our country must abolish the Electoral College is because it is a ""disaster factor"", as stated by Source 2. I agree with this for two reasons. First, because it does allow the people to vote for the president or candidate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is because most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More presiciely 60 percent of voters to dont want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it?

In conculsion, ""It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality"", according to Source 2. I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a ""Disaster Factor"" or causes many disruptions in our country.",0,"Dear State Senator 12315 I have a very strongly word persuasive letter write for you today of why our united nation must abolish the electoral college I be aware that the electoral college be one of the main way president 's become elect but it be serve an injustice to our nation people you must do something of the crisis that our country be face with the Electoral College I have two compelling reason of why the electoral college should be abolish

 my second reason of why our country must abolish the Electoral College be because it be a disaster factor as state by Source 2 I agree with this for two reason first because it do allow the people to vote for the president or candidate they prefer under the electoral college system voter vote not for the president but slate of elector who turn elect the president as state by the Indefensible Electoral College why even the well lay defense of the system be wrong I strongly agree with that except from the article I have state another reason why the Electoral college be a disaster factor be because most of the United States citizen prefer a direct election to the kind we have now Electoral College more presiciely 60 percent of voter to do nt want the electoral college that be majority of our population if majority of our nation be against the electoral college why have n't we abolish it

But does anyone think about what these traving pieces of machinery do to our planet? Cars are producing a environmentally harmful fumes such as greenhouse gas, and smog. These two chemicals are harmful for our ecosystems, as well as our health. It is unnessacary that people should be allowed to kill not only the nature that surrounds us, but also themselves so we need to become a carfree nation.

Giving up driving is like giving up a bad habit, you always have the urge to do it again. But is it all worth it. Think about it, you get up for wor, or school and you walk outside where the sun is shining and the birds are chirping and you think ""Wow it is beautiful out here"". And what do you do... you insert your self into a small metal barrier stoping you from being one with nature. so where am I going with this you might ask. ""When I had a car I was always tense.

In fact you cant have any social contact which is not healthy.

The U.S. is one of the largest producers, and consumer of motorized transportation devices. Companys such as Ford, Chevy, Jeep, and lincoln are producing cars that no one could refuse. But are they safe? Car companys advertise that they are ""safe"". Airbags, seatbelts, even blindspot protection moniters are some of the advances in vehicle safety technology, but technology does not alway work correctly. Most death tolls are not by murder, or suicide, but by car accidents. So why is it that all this technology that engineers are putting in our automobiles are not saving lives? This is why walking or running or cycling is an ideal choice of transportation, and why automobiles should come to an end.

Im not saying that all cars should be throw into a scrap yard and be forgot about. I know that there are those classic cars that every car collector wants, or that family car that has been passed down for ages. Im just stating that cars use should be reduced for the safty of our planet and ourselves. We always want to keep our old memories. Its just like keeping you grandmothers handmade scrapebook...priceless.

606,0,"As of April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was down 9 percent. So that means people are starting not to drive as much, which is not a bad thing. Actually they're many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can actually help the environment, help the emissions, and if we do limit car usage it can make cities denser as well as having some places that don't use cars. Which will be good for the world.

Transportation is really big in America. People drive all the time, were a moving country. So driving and using cars does effect our environment. One big thing going on is smog. One country that i can point out is Paris. Paris had so much smog that they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" according to the article Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer. Paris has more smog than other european capitals. Which is really bad because that can effect us as humans. In Bogota They are doing a program that involves banning cars for a day. The goal was to promote transportation and reduce smog which it did. So limiting car usage can improve safety and make the environment more clean.

Limiting car usage can also have beneficial implications for carbon emissions. If we created cities with pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, it can lower emissions and if the emissions are in good care then the environment will be to, ""since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" President Obama has goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions. Experts say"" Is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe..."" according to the article In German suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, by Elisabeth Rosenthal she says"" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United states. So thats pretty bad so if we limit car usage we can help fix that and maybe even have a lower percentage on emissions.

Vauban home to 5,500 residents are really taking limitation to cars serious. They may be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life. But they are doing really good. Other countries around the world are adopting what they are doing in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible, which is a good thing. Espescially for people that dont use cars, and especially if your trying to make the air more cleaner. According to In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, ""Vauban, copleted in 2006 is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "" Smart planing""."" This is a advantage for the world because we need to have someplaces that actually dont use cars. Also Vauban can inspire other countries to do the same. Which will be a advantage.

So they're are many advantages for limiting car usage. A lot has to do with the environment like it reduces smog and helps emissions which will be better for the world. The biggest advantage for limitation on car usage is pretty much a better world and who wouldnt want to live in a better world. It can also help other places be like Vauban. They don't use cars as much and it works for them, and a lot of people should start doing that. These advantages will really help the world if we do decide to ever limit car usage.",0,"as of April 2013 the number of mile drive per person be down 9 percent so that mean people be start not to drive as much which be not a bad thing actually they be many advantage to limit car usage limit car usage can actually help the environment help the emission and if we do limit car usage it can make city dense as well as have some place that do n't use car which will be good for the world

1502,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: An Explanatory Essay

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote more sustainable forms of transportation. This movement recognizes that the dependence on cars in suburban areas is a major obstacle to achieving these goals. By adopting smart planning principles and creating car-free communities, like the one in Vauban, Germany, we can enjoy several advantages, including reduced emissions, improved quality of life, and a stronger sense of community.

One of the most compelling reasons to limit car usage is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article in the New York Times, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint. For example, in the car-free community of Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. This reduction in car ownership has led to a noticeable decrease in emissions and a cleaner environment for the community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is an improved quality of life for residents. Rosenthal describes how the residents of Vauban, Germany, have more peaceful and less stressful lives since giving up their cars. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, explains that when she had a car, she was always tense, but now she is much happier. Without the noise and pollution of cars, the streets in Vauban are filled with the swish of bicycles and the laughter of children. This car-free environment provides a more tranquil and enjoyable living experience for residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can strengthen the sense of community in suburban areas. In the past, suburbs have been built around car ownership, with houses spread out and connected by extensive road networks. This type of development isolates residents and makes it difficult to interact with neighbors. However, by adopting the principles of smart planning and creating car-free communities, we can encourage more interaction and socialization among residents. In the new approach, stores are placed within walking distance, and public transportation becomes more accessible. This creates a sense of connectivity and encourages people to interact with their neighbors. As David Goldberg of Transportation for America states, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.""

In conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas offers several advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving quality of life, and fostering a sense of community, we can create a more sustainable and enjoyable living environment. It is crucial that we continue to explore and implement smart planning principles in order to promote car-free communities and reduce our dependence on cars. As the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota show, this movement is already gaining traction and has the potential to make a significant impact on our society.",1,"advantage of limit car usage an explanatory Essay

1655,0,"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This movement is driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the overall quality of life in urban areas. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage, including the German suburb of Vauban, the city of Paris, and the capital city of Colombia, Bogota.

The German suburb of Vauban serves as an example of the benefits of limiting car usage. In this suburb, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, and car ownership is allowed but limited. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move there. One resident of Vauban expressed her happiness with this lifestyle change, stating that she is much happier without a car and that having a car always made her feel tense. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to increased happiness and reduced stress for individuals.

Similarly, the city of Paris implemented a partial driving ban in response to severe smog pollution. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion in the city. This shows that limiting car usage can have a tangible impact on reducing pollution and improving air quality. It is worth noting that exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers, indicating that alternative forms of transportation are encouraged.

In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative forms of transportation and reduce smog. The event was a success, with millions of Colombians choosing to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work. This led to the streets of Bogota being devoid of traffic jams for a day. The mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, attended the event and praised the efforts of the people of Bogota in generating a revolutionary change. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can inspire other cities and countries to adopt similar measures and make a positive impact on transportation and the environment.

These examples highlight the advantages of limiting car usage. By reducing the number of cars on the road, greenhouse gas emissions can be significantly reduced. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas of the United States. Limiting car usage also improves air quality and reduces congestion in urban areas, leading to a better quality of life for residents. Additionally, promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, contributes to a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and reducing congestion.

560,1,"Dear Senator, We the people of the United States of America, desire a president who will not only care for the wellbeing of the citizens, but know what to do during times of crisis. The Electoral College is but one method of deciding this. There are many reasons as to why we need the Electoral College, and there are many reasons one can list of why we do not need it. If we were to get rid of the Electoral College completely and determine the win on the vote of the American citizens, chaos would ensue. Let's be honest, there are plenty of voters who have no idea what they are doing. If America were to base who would lead and call the shots of the country on the votes of everybody, then one person would end up being in office who is no better a ruler than a goldfish.

The Electoral College is noted as a process, not a place. This is correct. You don't just walk up to the Electoral College and say ""hey, this is who you should put into office"". Each state in the U.S. has a certain number of representativeselectors. For example, D.C.is treated like a state has 3 electors. People may say that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. While in some aspects this can be true, but if the electors know what they are doing and are willing to stay true to their country, then maybe the correct person would be elected in. The EC is known to require a Presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. A transregional appeal is when one area of the U.S. is known to be in favor of the presidential candidate.

Among the other things the Electoral College is known as being, it has been widely regarded as an anachronism. An anachronism is a person or thing that seems to belong in the past and not fit into the present time. While yes, the Electoral College is very old, it does have its uses. It is perhaps one of the final things that will determine what direction this great country gets set into, be it forwards or backwards. The larger the population of a state, the larger number of electors it has. Most of the states in the U.S. have what is called a ""winner takes all"" system. This system will award all of the electors to the presidential candidate that wins the election.

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, what is known as the AFLCIO, and the U.S Chamber of Commerce all agreed on just one thing. That thing that they all agreed on was to abolish the Electoral College. Over sixty percent of the U.S. population would rather have a direct election over what we currently use. Out of all the arguments against the Electoral College, one of the ""best"" is the Disaster Factor. One of the other worrying views on the Electoral College is what would occur if there were to be a tie in the vote. If a tie were to occur, the election would thus be thrown in the hands of the House of Representatives.

While there are many reasons to like, and dislike the Electoral College, one of the most reassuring should be that it most of the time will keep idiots out of the Oval Office. Among the reasons to dislike the Electoral College is that it is unfair, and keeps the majority of American people from using their voice. The Electoral College is the fine line between a country going backwards and causing the rest of the world to hate it, and a country going forwards, causing the rest of the world to hold it to a higher degree. If theres anything that the American people should want, it is a powerful and respectable leader who will do anything and everything they can for the citizens. Sincerely, An American.",0,"dear Senator we the people of the United States of America desire a president who will not only care for the wellbeing of the citizen but know what to do during time of crisis the Electoral College be but one method of decide this there be many reason as to why we need the Electoral College and there be many reason one can list of why we do not need it if we be to get rid of the Electoral College completely and determine the win on the vote of the american citizen chaos would ensue let we be honest there be plenty of voter who have no idea what they be do if America be to base who would lead and call the shot of the country on the vote of everybody then one person would end up be in office who be no well a ruler than a goldfish

 Richard Nixon Jimmy Carter Bob Dole what be know as the AFLCIO and the U.S Chamber of Commerce all agree on just one thing that thing that they all agree on be to abolish the Electoral College over sixty percent of the U.S. population would rather have a direct election over what we currently use out of all the argument against the Electoral College one of the good be the Disaster Factor one of the other worrying view on the Electoral College be what would occur if there be to be a tie in the vote if a tie be to occur the election would thus be throw in the hand of the House of Representatives 

 while there be many reason to like and dislike the Electoral College one of the most reassuring should be that it most of the time will keep idiot out of the Oval Office among the reason to dislike the Electoral College be that it be unfair and keep the majority of american people from use their voice the Electoral College be the fine line between a country go backwards and cause the rest of the world to hate it and a country go forwards cause the rest of the world to hold it to a high degree if there s anything that the american people should want it be a powerful and respectable leader who will do anything and everything they can for the citizen sincerely an American"
1326,1,"Dear State Senator, Electoral Colleges have many resources on why they should still be in favor of keeping but I strongly disagree. Changing to election by popular votes for the president of the United States is way more resourceful because Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president of the United States and not all regions may have an opportunity to vote.

To begin with, Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president. Source 2 ""Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" states "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect for the president."" This quote shows that if you vote for a slate of Republicans or Democratic electors pledged the president but those electors won the statewide election, those electors would have to go to Congress and the president would get the amount of electoral votes the people have made. It's a process having Electoral College systems therefore, it's much easier having popular votes for the president.

Furthermore, Source 3 ""Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" argues ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This quote is stating that not everyone has a saying on who they want their president to be. Like people in the South may have many electoral votes but not other regions like Northeast etc. The entire community should be able vote, everyone should be able to vote. Electoral college systems shouldn't be able to reject no ones vote. Moreover, changing elections to popular votes is better because people have a chance to vote the president they want.

Electoral College systems may be in favor in many ways like the winner takes all method, or each candidate running for president having their own electors. In whatever case it may be it's not fair to people having their own votes being rejected. Like i said in my previous paragraph everyone should have a saying on whom they want their president to be.

In conclusion, I'm in favor of chaging the elections by popular votes for the president of the United States because everyone has the saying on the president they wish to have. Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president of the United states and not all regions pf the United States have an opportunity to vote.",0,"Dear State Senator Electoral Colleges have many resource on why they should still be in favor of keep but I strongly disagree change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States be way more resourceful because Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president of the United States and not all region may have an opportunity to vote

1344,1,"Dear state senator, Ever since 1776, The United States of America has been a great example of freedom, excellence, and democracy. After all, the U.S. is one of the biggest supporters of democracy, and is all about the rights of their people. So imagine my shock to learn that this country, in fact, does not rely on it's people to vote for their leader. Which, to many people would be the simplest form of freedom out there. Instead, we have the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a number of electors that represent a state. ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...."" What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register In this quote, it explains that the Electoral College is based on the existing population in your state therefore, the more people you have, the more electors the state receives. However, this sounds great and all, but in my opinion, a direct democracy would work great for this country because it would generate just representation of the people by allowing them to make the vote, encourage voters and remind them that they have a voice, and immediately destroy the chances of a representative to vote for an opposing candidate.

America is all about their people. And of course, the government wants to do what's best for them, right? Voting is a right that American citizens achieve when they reach the matured age of eighteen. It's supposed to feel like a blessing that we get to decide and have a voice in the process of election. But, with the Electoral College, it ""...may turn off potential voters of a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner So the citizens of this country are beginning to feel like their say in this decision will have little to no impact. This will affect the amount of voters and will ultimately cause a huge problem in the way people feel about representation.

Enough about the people, how about the electors? ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer This means that not even when the people vote for all their electors and they should be selecting the correct candidate, they may change their minds. Electors are people too, and people may have their opinions swayed and then the electors could vote for the other candidate. It is scary to think that the candidate everyone chose and was rooting for might not win because someone decided to make a different decision.

And some people might stand up for the Electoral College, say that ""The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates...to focus their campain efforts on the tossup states."" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner It later goes on to say that because of this, the citizens in the Swing States become the most thoughtful voters because they receive the most information on the candidates. However, wouldn't we, as a country, prefer all of our potential voters to be informed and wellaware of our candidates? ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states...focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer Why should the fate of the presidency be laid in the hands of such a small amount of people when our country is meant to be for everybody in the land?

As a concluding statement, senator, I want you to consider my argument that we'd be better off without the Electoral College because citizens should be able to decide who they want to run, they should feel important, they should all be wellinformed, and electors that change their minds wouldn't even be a problem anymore.

1170,0,"Fresh clean air, spotless streets and no car accidents. Welcome to Vauban, Germany. The 5,500 people of this town are a part of something that this day and age has never seen. The residents here have given up their cars, and are a part of an experiment where their streets are completely ""carfree""!

After this experiment started in Germany, it's population would agree that the tenseness they were feeling with their cars is now gone. This new way of living was started in 2006 and other countries would agree that it is a smart move and an affordable way of living. The residents of Vauban have more money to spend on other necessities such as clothing and food, or maybe some entertainment, even. All of their monthly car payments and gasoline bills have ceased to exist because they simply have no reason to pay the prices anymore without a car. Citizens of this little town don't have to walk or ride their bikes far because the city has thought this movement out very well. All of the stores are placed just a walk away rather than their malls being placed on a distant highway. Public transportation has become more accessible and there is more space for sidewalks rather than roads. For some, this is a dream town for them and their children. There isn't much of a worry about air pollution or accidents.

If you were to compare vaughn's air pollution to being's the difference would be astounding. Just last night, NBC Nightly News showed the city of Bejing where the smog was so dense that visibility was reduced to almost none. The majority of the population won't go outside with out wearing a mask to protect them selves. All of the air pollutants could be harming us even with a potential risk of lung cancer. The mayor of Bejing has even made a statement talking about his city's air, and the risk and threat it poses to his residents. Even the common person will recognize that the gas emissions from a car's tail pipe equals pollution. Paris officials knew this too, and understood that their city had an air cleanliness issue. So, in an effort to make the City of Love more pleaseable they limited what cars could drive on what days. They enforced a partial driving ban to clear the smog in the city. For a short amount of time only evennumbered cars, for example, could drive on a Monday. If odd numbered cars were on the street then there would be a 22 Euro fine that equals 31 USD's. After 5 days, car traffic and conjestion was down around 60% on the streets, and the air pollution started clearing.

Fatal crashes are among the one of the third highest risks for all American's. Some states have even made it a law to not text and drive, and in some states there probably is a ""no talking on the cell phone law"" too! If the number of cars are reduced or taken away all together I feel that the lives of the American people are less at risk. Every day, and not just in this country, hundreds of people are injuring them selves or getting killed by distracted driving, hitandruns, and driving under the influence. It could be beneficial to cut down the car usage and up the number of public transportation avaible to the public.

In any major city you go to in the United States, all around you, you can notice the large amounts of people walking to where they need to go. In Washington D.C. bike rentals are EVERYWHERE. And if you don't want to take a bike then take the D.C. Metro. The same will go for New York City or anywhere with a large population of people. You will also notice that city folk tend to be slimmer than others. That is most likley due to the fact that they walk everywhere. Just like I mentioned before, like Vauban, eveything in a major city is usually within walking distance. As we all know, walking is a form of excersize and it is recomemnded by health officials that each person should get at least 1 hour every day and it is very believeable that a city goer gets plenty more than the recomended. The first lady has started a program for children in an effort to get them moving, fit and healthy as well. Some children in New York City won't even drive a single day in their lives or worry about what could happen if they do. Also, the Capital of ColombiaBogota has organized a day for it's residence to avoid taking their car. It is called the Day Without Cars and the major goal is to reduce smog and promote walking.

All in all.. Cars, the most dangerous driving force in our daily lives, should be cut back on. Even with study after study coming out and proving just how danger and nonbeneficial to our health they are, they are slowly losing populatiry. If this pattern stays consistant then sociologists say that it will have great effects on the atmosphere, and our healthy lives that we all live.",0,"fresh clean air spotless street and no car accident welcome to Vauban Germany the 5,500 people of this town be a part of something that this day and age have never see the resident here have give up their car and be a part of an experiment where their street be completely carfree

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While I understand that there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is essential in maintaining the integrity and fairness of our presidential elections.

First and foremost, it is important to understand the purpose and history of the Electoral College, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register in their publication ""What Is the Electoral College?"" The Electoral College was established as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote, allowing for an equitable representation of both states and individuals. It consists of 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President. This system ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process, preventing larger states from dominating the outcomes. Critics argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic, but its purpose is to protect the interests of all states and promote national unity.

One of the main concerns raised by opponents of the Electoral College is the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the presidency, as mentioned in Bradford Plumer's article ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" While this has occurred on rare occasions, it is crucial to note that such cases are infrequent. The current system ensures the certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of disputes and confusion. In addition, the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates from focusing solely on highly populated areas and neglecting the concerns of citizens in less populated states. As Judge Richard A. Posner states in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" this system encourages candidates to campaign throughout the country, thereby promoting inclusivity and preventing regional disengagement.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system protects swing states, as stated by Judge Richard A. Posner. By focusing campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates must address the concerns and desires of a broader range of voters. This encourages voters in these states to become more engaged and informed about the candidates and their policies. Without the Electoral College, candidates would concentrate their efforts on densely populated urban areas, potentially leaving rural and less populous areas marginalized and unheard.

The Electoral College also provides an important balance of power between large and small states, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner. The system properly acknowledges the constitutional provision of equal representation for each state in the Senate. This prevents candidates from solely targeting large states, making smaller states relevant and their interests considered. It also discourages the need for run-off elections, which could complicate the election process and lead to further polarization within the country.

Although critics argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters, particularly in states that are consistently favorable towards one party, it is worth noting that the voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, as explained by Judge Richard A. Posner. Voters understand the significance of expressing their political preference. Furthermore, a popular vote system could result in only highly populated states receiving campaign attention, leaving other states feeling neglected and rendering their voters irrelevant.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has served our nation well for over two centuries, providing a balance of power, ensuring regional inclusivity, and promoting national unity. It protects the voice of smaller states, encourages trans-regional appeal, and maintains certainty of outcome. While some reforms may be necessary to address certain concerns and make the system more efficient, completely abandoning the Electoral College would undermine the principles and values upon which our democracy was founded.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh these arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College. It is my hope that you will continue to support this important aspect of our democratic process.

Yours sincerely,

1373,1,"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we ""abolish"" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter.",0,"there have be a fuss about the Elector College many people get confused about how it work and if they be satisfied with the whole process show we abolish the Elector College should we keep it honestly we should keep it we the peope have more then enough control on who be choose for the president of the United States of America we do n't really vote for the president but our vote impact the decision

In Germany the people have made a city where they have given up their cars. The city I believe has a better way to maintain a healthy and cleaner environment than other cities in Germany. The banning of cars has been a great success with now people using bikes or walking as their means of transportation. Even though car ownership is permitted,the problem is that there are only two places to park which cost about 40,000 dollars along with your home. The result of that actions is that 70 percent of people do not own a car and 57 percent sold the car to live in the city. One person states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" says Heidrun Walter. The citizens of this city have been feeling better about having no car you dont have the stress to have to drive you have the calm relaxing time by walking or biking. did you know that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in car intensive areas in the United States.""The greenhouse gas has been a problem ever since the development of motor power cars. Now that we are able to stop it lets take that chance to help stop the greenhouse gas and to make cleaner and healthier cities.

The romantic city of paris is having a bit of a problem its that its beautiful city is now being coveres in smog due to the overuse of cars. now that Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to help clear the air they can't help to notice that when there are fewer cars being operated the smog begins to clear up. The smog has always been a problem for Paris it usually has more smog than in any European country. The article states that ""Paris has 147 micrograms of perticulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,Reuters found."" The romantic city of Paris cant be as wonderful if it always has a problem with having too much smog I believ that the cars are the ones to blame for this matter that if the city of paris bans its cars that the smog will decrease and become a the romantic city that it is. The article states that ""diesel fuel was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western Europe."" That means that it is in fact the motor cars that are the ones causeing the overflow of the smog. If the the cars are able to to be banned in paris we will see a drop in the smog and Paris will return to the romantic city that it is.

The city of Bogota,Colombia has been celebrating the day without cars for over three years straight. The car free day help leave the streets of the capital city without any traffic jams. One problem of the road that many countries have in their capital city is that they have to many cars because of the tourist and the huge number of people who live there which causes traffic jams leaving cars in the streets for hours on end. They have the same problem in Brazil where they have one of the worlds worst traffic jams in history. The ones who delevoped the car free day was trying to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Someone states in the article ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The stress of having a car in a countries capital can be stressful to some people and that bikeing or walking is a way to help calm someone after a busy day at work. Due to the car free day the city states that ""uneven, pitted side walks have been replaced by broad,smooth sidewalks, rush hour restirictions have dramatically cut traffic.""The car free day i feel is benefitting everyone from getting rid of traffic jams to clearing up the smog. The replacing of cars for bikes and walking is not so much a bad idea if it will help benefit evryone around you.

In conclusion, the car culture is now coming to its end. That nations all over the world has seen the great benefits from banning cars. The greatest effects that banning cars has is that they are helping to get rid of air pollution,stress,and the grreenhouse gas. These are all benfits for everyone it helps the ither people beside u and the environment. The romantic city of Paris was covered in smog due to cars. In Germany where they have developed a city where there is no car in sight and has everything within a walking or bike distance. The city of Bogota,Colombia making a holiday that has been going on for three years straight to have no cars for a day. The people have been seeing that the effects of having no car is wonderful and that we should all do it to better ourselves and to better out enivornment.",0,"the culture of the car have be come to an end with many people now choose to have other form of transportation now in Germany they be make city where they help ban car usage in the romantic city of Paris France they be now start to ban car due to the overload of smog the city of Bogota colombia be have a special day where they ban car and see the effect of now have car for a day the car usage be now be observe to do damage around the world and due to that now city all over the world be now ban the car usage this will help to have a healthy earth and healthy people the benefit of ban car be go to help everyone and even our beloved earth

627,1,"Dear Senator, I feel the need to eliminate the Electoral College process of voting and just have a regular election where the President with the most votes wins, as simple as that. Each vote counts as one, and there will be more or less votes depending on the state and its size and population.

Just like Source 2, I feel ""The electorsal College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. "" ""Abolish the electorsal college!"". When you vote, you vote for ""a slate of electorss, who in turn elect the President"" Source 2, Paragraph 2. Why can't it just be a regular election where you either bubble your democrat or republican representative instead of being so complicated and misleading. This can get people confused, and get them to vote for the wrong candidate without them even realizing! ""Do voters sometimes get confused about the electorss and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" Source 2, Paragraph 2. In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't even get to see the candidates in a campaign ads they focus on the ""bigger"" and more important swingstates to win. Each person should count as one, and each state should be as important as the other, just varying in the number of voters they had.

In Source 1, it says how ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electorss, the meeting of the electorss where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electorsal votes by Congress."" You're electing electorss instead of just who you want for President. To top it off, you can't even control who your electorss vote for! So people can vote for an electors thinking that he's going to vote for the Republican party but then he votes for the Democratic party. This process can be very misleading. ""Can voters control whom their electorss vote for? Not always."". The disaster factor as mentioned in Source 2 could aways occur.

Some counterarguments might include the certainty of outcome, and how the Electoral Vote might be greater than the Popular Vote. But at the end of the day, the people are nominating their president, they don't want others to do it for them. The Popular Vote representing our country as a whole with all individual votes added up should be the deciding factor. A tie is almost impossible in that circumstance also, because what are the chances out of millions of citizens the number would be perfectly split in half. If a president appeals for a region, then let them vote for who they believe is the better candidate. At the end of the day, the majority wins. Swing states won't have to be a factor without the Electoral College, and big states are just counted them same, one point per vote. Runoff elections won't be necessary if the highest percentage president wins, even if its not majority.

So, hopefully you see my view on this issue and the Electoral College can be eliminated.",0,"dear Senator I feel the need to eliminate the Electoral College process of voting and just have a regular election where the President with the most vote win as simple as that each vote count as one and there will be more or less vote depend on the state and its size and population

1226,1,"Are you the kind of person that is really interested in political stuff? Politics can be a subject that will start fights, but not everyone is so interested. You must know what the electoral college is. It is a system where when you vote for your president you are actually voting for a group of electors that will then vote for the presidentSource 1. This means that even if there is a majority in the popularity vote from the people. The electoral college can over rule that and vote for the other. Some say the electoral college is good because it prevents ties or because it will make sure there is a winner. But if they can over rule your vote are you really voting for your president? I say the electoral college is a bad system and it needs to be extinguished.

There is no doubt that you should get to decide who your leader will be. And if the electoral college can over rule your vote do you really feel like it's your decision? In the 2000 presidential race, Al Gore lost because he recieved the most popularity votes from the people but the electoral college voted for Bush insteadSource 2. This means that the people thought Al Gore should be the president but instead they didn't get what they wanted because the electoral college thought otherwise. Do you think this is in anyway fair? The majority of the country ended up unhappy with the election because of ther electoral college. I say that alone is enough reason to abolish the electoral college. If it happens once it can happen again. Do you want to feel cheated and betrayed again? Let's get rid of the electoral college!

Some others may say that they support the electoral college because it can't have a tie. ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality ina state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state.""Source 3. It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a slight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes.

""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""Source 2. This alone shows that your votes are being represented equally. It is saying that 500,000 votes are equal to 35 million votes. Isn't it obvious that those two numbers are very different and they could have a very large effect on the popularity of each candidate that they are voting for? but instead they have they same effect and the 34.5 million voters that don't get their fair say could very possibly be unhappy with the turnout of the president. The people are supposed to be the ones that vote for their leader, not a group of 538 ""qualified"" politicians that can over rule the entire country's vote. It's ridiculous how the system works and you are crazy if you support it. I know i want my fair share of input and the electoral college won't allow that.

There are supporters who say that they support the electoral college because it avoids runoff elections. Because even if there is a tie in the majority votes from the people it is unlikey for there to be a tie in the votes from the electoral college. ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral College...""Source 3. In my opinion if there is a tie in the popularity votes then they should revote, it may take longer but it will still be a decision by the people. Just because it makes the procces faster doesnt mean it makes the procces better. They can create a better system in the event of a tie instead of electors over ruling the people and picking whoever they think is best. That isnt government for the people, by the people.

In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.",0,"be you the kind of person that be really interested in political stuff politic can be a subject that will start fight but not everyone be so interested you must know what the electoral college be it be a system where when you vote for your president you be actually vote for a group of elector that will then vote for the presidentsource 1 this mean that even if there be a majority in the popularity vote from the people the electoral college can over rule that and vote for the other some say the electoral college be good because it prevent tie or because it will make sure there be a winner but if they can over rule your vote be you really vote for your president I say the electoral college be a bad system and it need to be extinguish

2087,1,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you as a concerned citizen of our great state to address a subject that has sparked much debate in recent years; the functionality of the Electoral College in presidential elections. Personally, I express my support for preserving the Electoral College as our method of selecting a president due to its unique attribute of ensuring all states and regions are considered and represented, among other formidable reasons mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, ""In Defense of the Electoral College.""

As you know, the Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between the popular vote of qualified citizens and the election of the President by a vote in Congress, providing us with a balancing system of representation. As pointed out by Judge Posner, the Electoral College not only provides an outcome with certainty (Reason 1), but it also obliges presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal (Reason 2). It requires candidates to cater to the needs and interests of voters across all states, big and small, and not merely in densely populated urban areas or populous states. This ensures that every voice, every state, has a meaningful say in presidential elections.

Nonetheless, critics argue that the Electoral College contributes to the disenfranchisement of those living in ""safe"" states, as underlines in Bradford Plumer's article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" adding that it promotes the unfairness in our electoral process. Yet, I respectfully disagree based on the benefits it offers. A popular vote system may reduce the motivation for candidates to appeal to a wide variety of voters across the nation, leading to a skewed emphasis on high population areas alone. In contrast, even though the Electoral College makes certain states more influential during elections due to being ""swing"" states (Reason 3), it upholds the importance of both populous and less-populous states (Reason 4), supporting our federalist system and maintaining essential balance in our democracy.

The utilization of the Electoral College helps to avoid potential election complications such as run-off elections in scenarios where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote (Reason 5). Despite its perceived shortcomings, the Electoral College does indeed have an incredibly important function in our democracy.

I understand that this is a complex issue with thoughtful perspectives on both sides of the debate. However, I urge you to continue supporting the Electoral College, a system that protects a fundamental aspect of our democracy - ensuring every state has a voice in the election of our president. We must maintain this system, and if necessary, work to educate the public on its workings and crucial role in our presidential elections.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,

1604,0,"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. The passage set provides examples from various parts of the world that demonstrate the positive impact of reducing reliance on cars.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, these emissions can be significantly reduced. Vauban, a town in Germany, serves as an excellent example of this. With the majority of families not owning cars, the streets are car-free, resulting in a substantial decrease in emissions. Similarly, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog caused by car emissions. As a result, congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent.

Limiting car usage also has health benefits. Cars contribute to air pollution, which can have adverse effects on human health. The smog in Paris, for instance, rivaled that of heavily polluted cities like Beijing. By reducing car usage, the air quality improves, reducing respiratory problems and other health issues. Bogota in Colombia implemented a car-free day to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event has been successful in changing people's behavior and has been replicated in other cities as well.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the opportunity for more compact and accessible communities. Traditionally, suburbs have been designed around car use, which has led to increased traffic congestion and sprawling developments. However, efforts are being made to create suburban areas that prioritize public transportation and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Vauban in Germany is a prime example of this approach, where stores are located within walking distance on a main street, reducing the need for long car journeys to shopping malls.

Reducing car usage can also have economic benefits. Delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban, highlighting the reliance on cars for certain businesses. However, by shifting to alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or public transportation, individuals can save money on fuel and car maintenance costs.

Overall, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more accessible communities and promoting healthier lifestyles. While the transition may require changes in infrastructure and individual habits, the benefits to both individuals and the environment make it a worthwhile endeavor.",1,"limit car usage can have numerous advantage for individual community and the environment the passage set provide example from various part of the world that demonstrate the positive impact of reduce reliance on car

290,0,"Automobiles have been used as the average use of transportation ever since the Was there any other reason to use anything other than a car after that, no not really but now there are. After so many decades there arrives three valid reasons to limit the average joes use of their motor vehicle. One, you can reduce the smog build up in your cities, two as well as smog greenhouse gases heavy up on areas in the Earths atmosphere but can be helped, three people use public transportation more as well as riding their bikes and walking. if you can limit your selves on car use, you can create a better tomorow.

First off, reducing smog in your area. smog is generated out of the tail pipes of motor vehicles and is bad for the environment and atmosphere. with limiting your daily car commute you can remove a good part from your area. when Paris had ordered that only plates that only odd number plates could drive on the roads on monday their large smog cloud of 147 micrograms of PM per cubic meter smog was greatly reduce and lifted the following day. so just one day of cutting the daily car commute in half a city as big as Paris was able to lift a smog.

moving along, the green house gases. Green house gases a like smog is a by product of driving your every day car to and fro work. green house gases are dangerous chemical gases that eat away at earths Ozone layer letting in UV rays that can be very harmful to you and the rest of the ecosystem. bogota recently had a car free day in which no one was allowed to drive motor vehicles except for buses and taxis. their goal was to promote alternative uses of transportation as well as lowering the amount of green house gases let into Earths atmosphere. doing something like what bogota can help cut down on all the harsh chemicals being let off into the atmosphere.

lastly, finding other sources of transportation other than every day car. finding another way of getting around is great for the community, it keeps you healthy and the earth healthy. Vauban germany is actually a car free city, it does not have roads on which you can drive upon but only a main street. everything that is needed in the town is no longer a car ride away but a bike ride away or a walk down the road resulting in a very community both people and ecosystem. as well as that is also saves people money not haveing to buy or a car for that matter. now think on how it would be like if your city did this and how much it would benefir from it.

In conclusion, having a car free day or banning about half the cars from driving on one day is not a bad thing but instead a good thing. once again you can reduce the smog, you ca even help keep green house gases out of the atmosphere, and for the last time find other healthier ways of getting around. so to ask the simple question why would you not limit your everyday car use.",0,"automobile have be use as the average use of transportation ever since the be there any other reason to use anything other than a car after that no not really but now there be after so many decade there arrive three valid reason to limit the average joe use of their motor vehicle one you can reduce the smog build up in your city two as well as smog greenhouse gas heavy up on area in the Earths atmosphere but can be help three people use public transportation more as well as ride their bike and walk if you can limit your self on car use you can create a well tomorow

853,0,"Cars in this century are being band for multiple reasons. To most people, cars are a hastle and a pain to deal with. Advantages to limiting car usage are the less parking areas and more community buildings, the reduction of smogpolution, and more exercise for Americans. Most cars are getting better with the limitation on gas and more on battery, but we should still limit cars in general.

If you walk along the streets in New York, you will see that along every sidewalk there is a parking strip and around every corner there is a parking lot. What if those parking spots were gone? We could have larger and more store then we have now, plus we could have larger sidewalks to bike and walk on. In Vauban, Germany, generally street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden. The house owners are allowed to own cars, but transportation is limited due to the limited parking areas. Suburban inhabitants mainly use a source of public transportation because of how cheap and easy it is.

Smog is a fume that comes from cars and lingers around that area. It makes the whole area fill up with gas that it looks like a huge fog bank. China is the worst contributor to smog due to all its factories which make cars. Paris is trying to limit the amount of smog in their area so they restricted the use of cars for five days. After the five days, Paris cleared up and the people there were able to see a lot clearer.

America is known to be a fat country. All the people in American sit around and eat everything, are really lazy, and rely to much on machines. If we cut down on machines, including cars, a whole lot of Americans would lose a lot of weight. Larger sidewalks would help a whole lot for bikes. Bikes would give you exercise and help you be self relient instead on relying on the car. A professor at The University of Michigan has a son who lives is San francisco, who he says has a car but never uses it. He always uses the public transportation, and why's that? More than likely it is because in San francisco the traffic changes rapidly and you don't know if you will hit bad traffic. Also, San francisco is a beautiful place to be, and he may want to enjoy the view in that area.

Cars have taken over the United States in many ways that we know about but don't care or don't do anything about it.. America and everwhere else could have a lot more stores and get more exercise if parking lots, parking spots along the sidewalk, and some cars are gone. Smog is not a good gas to have lingering around where a whole bunch of people are walking and living.

Subject: In Defense of the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While I understand that there are arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides numerous benefits that outweigh any potential drawbacks.

First and foremost, the Electoral College system ensures a certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard Posner points out, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. In addition, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. This certainty of outcome is crucial for maintaining stability and confidence in our electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters a strong sense of unity and representation. By requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that no single region can dominate the election. This means that a candidate with only regional support is unlikely to be successful, as they would not be able to effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. Therefore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationwide and develop policies that take into account the diverse needs and perspectives of various regions.

The system also gives more weight to swing states, which encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on these states. As a result, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, be well-informed about the candidates, and make thoughtful decisions. This is important for ensuring that the most engaged and informed voters have the final say in determining the outcome of the election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it provides representation for both large and small states. While the popular vote may favor candidates who focus solely on densely populated areas, the Electoral College guarantees that candidates must consider the interests of smaller states as well. This balance is necessary to ensure that all states have a voice and are not overwhelmed by the influence of a few densely populated areas.

Finally, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections, which can complicate and prolong the election process. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College provides a streamlined and efficient method for electing the President.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a reliable and effective mechanism for electing the President of the United States. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes national unity and representation, encourages attention to swing states, provides a voice for both larger and smaller states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there may be arguments for a popular vote system, the benefits offered by the Electoral College outweigh any potential drawbacks.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I hope that you will continue to support the Electoral College system. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need further information.

553,1,"To whom this may concern, The ""winner takes all"" system we've been using doesn't work. Less power is essentially being given to the people, and, some are even being ignored.

In cases such as Al Gore's, the people said yes, and the College said no. And, voters didn't like this. According to a gallop poll in 2000, after Al Gore lost the race, ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"", meaning, or. Senator, it's time for change. In addition, this system easily allows for a tie. In this event, the results of the race would be decided by the House of Representatives, which we all know would swiftly put in a vote for the Republican candidate. And, since the Senate has also been recently dominated by Republicans, they too would choose one of their own, resulting in two branches of the government dominated by one political party.

Moreover, with this faulty system, many people are being ignored. As you may recall or not, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""Source 2, Paragraph 13 Although not seeing the ads might not have been a bad thing. I'm just kidding. Why is this important? Because the people need to see and meet their candidates, but due to the electoral collage, people are being ignored. If the majority of the votes are known to be going to one candidate or the other, they will most likely not be visited by either side, because whom that state's electoral votes are going to are essentially locked in. The only states that recieve any attention are the ""Swing states"" Source 2, Paragraph 13 that are pretty equal on both sides and can be easily swayed to pick one candidate or the other.

The only evidence to refute my claim would be that ""Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation"" Source 1, Paragraph 7, which actually might work however, this would require all the states to change their policies, which we all know won't happen very easily.

So, in summary, or. Senator, the way things work is going to need to change, we are being ignored and elections are being thrown. If you don't help us change this, the power of electing the president is going to remain with our, faulty, college.",0,"to whom this may concern the winner take all system we have be use do n't work Less power be essentially be give to the people and some be even be ignore

690,1,"We as Americans have the right to vote for who we want to be president. American citizens should be able to vote directly for the president, not for a state of electors. This is why we need to abolish the Electoral College. It is unreasonable, unfair, and unreliable to the people. In recent times, the Electoral College has been known to have made mistakes on purpose and on accident. The Electoral College system that they have going now is very unorganized and needs to be changed. It is about time that we change the way our citizens vote for our president. This is a huge deal to our country considering the fact that the president is one of the most important people in the country. We as American citizens should be able to trust that our vote was for the candate they chose.

First of all, lets discuss the past issue that have happened withe Electoral College system. The incident in 1960 with John F. Kennedy was a huge disaster. As said in source 2 ""...The Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This is a perfect example of how the Electoral College is a misused way of voting. They tried to basically sabotage Kennedy's election. What about other problems that also occur with this system? The voters can't always control who their electors vote for. The confusion is a big key factor in the situations also. voters can easily get confuse about the electors and they will accidentally vote for the wrong candidate.

The peoples rights. Dont they have a right of who becomes president? They should. The Electoral College is taking away from the excitement of getting to make a huge decision on who will run the country. When a teenager finally becomes eighteen, what do you think is on their mind? Freedom. And part of getting their freedom is getting to vote for their country. The people should have the right to vote for whoever they may choose and trust that it went for the person they chose and not to a state of electors to vote for them. It's in the facts that more people prefer to have a direct election. The people think that it is unfair to their rights and we all believe that it is not the best way to decide who runs our country.

Organization is a key factor in this country. So why aren't we showing it? The voting system that we use to this day is very unorganized and has many flaws. The Electoral College is much to confusing of a system that we need to be using. We need to change our system now while we can before we hit another mistake. We need to take advantage of the freedom that we have in this country of ours and make a difference. We can change this system so it is much easier and more reliable to vote from. The people want it, so it's about time that the government stands up and agrees with us on that point. We can change our disorganization.

Our country needs to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I have discussed the problems our country has faced with Electoral College system, and hopefully it changes your view on what really is the right and better thing to do for our country. Voting is a very big deal here in America and it is one of the ways it shows we have freedom. The voting system would be much more organized if the system were changed to direct vote by the people. That is the right way. Its about time we change the system for the better.",0,"we as Americans have the right to vote for who we want to be president american citizen should be able to vote directly for the president not for a state of elector this be why we need to abolish the Electoral College it be unreasonable unfair and unreliable to the people in recent time the Electoral College have be know to have make mistake on purpose and on accident the Electoral College system that they have go now be very unorganized and need to be change it be about time that we change the way our citizen vote for our president this be a huge deal to our country consider the fact that the president be one of the most important people in the country we as american citizen should be able to trust that our vote be for the candate they choose

1108,0,"Automobiles have proved to be very convenient to our modern day society. It allows people to travel 20 miles in ten to fifteen minutes. By foot, it would take about four hours to travel that distance. Although cars have been beneficial, the limitation of car usage would outweigh the benefits of constantly relying on them. Decreasing the amount of time we spend in them would improve public transportation, improve air quality, and create less stress.

Cutting down the amount of car usage would encourage the use of public transportation. According to Source 1, the essentially carless suburban, Vanbaun, has made public transportation more accessible. Increasing the use of it would decrease the time it takes to commute from place to place. Less cars on the roads mean less traffic. In small towns, not as many people currently use the system on a regular basis. With the limiting of car usage, public transportation could become more popular in suburban areas, not just metropolitan cities. Some may not want to take this form of transportation because it may not meet their sanitary needs. However, if the popularity increases, cities will be obligated to improve the conditions. Public transportation could be the new primary form of transportation if we limit the amount of time cars are allowed to be used.

Additionally, a large problem in the world today is air pollution and global warming. Automobiles cause the majority of this ongoing problem. Less time spent in the car would eventually lead to better air quality. Source 2 states that in Paris, France the smog in the city was nearrecord pollution. This caused Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Congestion was cut down 60% after this action was taken. Vehicles release numerous harmful greenhouse gases that we have been trying to reduce. These gases not only harm the environment, but the people as well. New and popular alternatives to the common diesel cars are hybrids and electric cars. Less car usage would result in reduction of pollution.

Also, using a car less decreases stress levels. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in the very popular carfree day. A businessman in Colombia said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" Cars do not allow people's mind to stop and rest. A driver's mind is constantly thinking and attempting to get to their destination as fast as possible. If cars were barely used, people could take a serene stroll to their destination, allowing the mind to slow down, think, and relax. Parks and recreation would expand and improve as well due to the smaller vicinity we can reach by foot or bike. New and improved public areas would become more enjoyable, making us less stressed. Stress levels decline as car usage declines.

The increased use of public transportation, improved air quality, and lower stress levels all result from the limitations of car usage. As beneficial as a car may be to people, limiting the use of it is more advantageous than not. Car companies are still widely developing as highways and roads are expanding, but our society should go the other direction and find healthier sources of transportation.",0,"automobile have prove to be very convenient to our modern day society it allow people to travel 20 mile in ten to fifteen minute by foot it would take about four hour to travel that distance although car have be beneficial the limitation of car usage would outweigh the benefit of constantly rely on they decrease the amount of time we spend in they would improve public transportation improve air quality and create less stress

961,0,"""You can live in your car, but you can't drive your house."" This is a quote my teacher used to tell me as advise for the future. This was a way of saving money if you had to choose between paying rent or paying your car bills if you were in this situation. However, what he did not realize is its more useful to use less of your car.

Using less of your car improves the environment. Using less will reduce the pollution in the air that we breathe in. When we reduce our car use we reduce the amount of resources like fossil fuels and nonreuseable resources. When we use cars and create pollution we also create a smog, but when we stop using cars we can clear the smog. In paris, they banned car use for a certain amount of time and it reduced the amount of smog. In fact, in the article Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog , it says ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Another thing that reduces is your payments for your car. How can you pay for a car if you don't have one? The answer is you don't. Without a car you don't have to pay car payments or repair payments. You also don't have to worry about getting fines or looking for parking spaces. In the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , it reads ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" If you are not already worried with you car payments, you would be worried about your children's safety. Accidents happen all the time from cars. And if you're not in an accident you could be the one with a car breakdown on your way to work. Now you may say, I need a car because I have to drive to work or drop my kids at school. Than here is a solution, in the article The End of Car Culture it says, ""Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" My teacher's quote about paying for cars is more useful than paying rent is incorrect. Using less of your car is an advantage to improving the environment, spending less money, and increasing safety in the world.",0,"you can live in your car but you ca n't drive your house this be a quote my teacher use to tell I as advise for the future this be a way of save money if you have to choose between pay rent or pay your car bill if you be in this situation however what he do not realize be its more useful to use less of your car

185,1,"Dear me. Senator, I am fed up with the electoral college. The system allows for so much disaster to occur. It isn't strict at all and it allows a variety of things to happen that wouldn't end well. The people deserve to make the decisions. Because the electoral college systems has so many holes and problems with it.

One of the best arguments against the electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. One big example of the disaster factor is the 2000 year election. In this election Al Gore had more votes than George Bush, but still lost by 5 votes because of the electoral college. In 1960, segregationists in Louisiana almost succeeded in replacing the democratic electors who oppose John F. Kennedy. If they succeeded and the popular vote went to Kennedy, it would not have actually gone to Kennedy. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" Plumer Second off, one of the most worrying things is if there is a tie in the electoral vote. If that happens the election vote would be given to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote for the president. The vice president vote is given to the senate. Each state only casts one vote which insures that 55 million voters and 500,000 have the same power. Given the size of those numbers, and that people in those states may vote one party for president and one party for congress, the House's decision could hardly reflect on the peoples choice. We have come pretty close to this happening too, in 1976 a tie would have occurred if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted differently. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" Plumer There is a few reasons that opposing opioninated people use to justify wanting to keep the Electoral College around. One of them is that the president has to appeal to multiple regions. A candidate can not just be a favor of the south and get elected, he has to campaign and be desirable to all the regions. This is good because a president that was popular in just one region would not be successful, because everyone else in the other regions would feel like they do not regard their interests. Unfortuanitly this is solved by popular vote, since it is by individual not by state. Other votes in other states balance them out. ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" Poser The Electoral College has many reasons for it and against it. But I strongly feel that we should get rid of it for the reasons shown above. From the ""Disaster factor"" to the threat of a electoral tie.

1077,1,"Florida Senator I had not known much about the electoral college until now, and I am appalled that this election process has been used ever since the establishment of the Constitutiondecades ago. The electoral college is unfair, raises dispute, does not provide an accurate representation of the country's vote as a whole, and the process is simply not logical. I feel like we, as a country, could avoid a great deal of dispute that arises, regarding the electoral college voting system, if it were changed to election by popular vote.

First of all, when the electoral college voting system is used, while people may think they are voting for a presidential candidate, they are not. Voters are actually choosing a group of electors that then elect a president. Shouldn't something that has a great impact on our country, such as electing the president of the United States, be chosen by the people living in the country under the president's decisions? Anyone would agree that the people should have the power to contribute to these decisions, yet somehow the electors are taking this huge responsibility into their own hands.

Another issue with the electoral college is that it gives candidates different motives for their campaign. I believe that in an electoral campaign, candidates should be advertising their views equally to all parts of the country, if all parts of the country get to have a say in their voting. However, most of the time, entire countries are skipped over by candidates, as if they don't matter, so that the candidates can talk to states that they find more important to get a vote from. In the election of 2000, a seventeen whole states didn't see the candidates at all, and some of the larger states didn't see a single campaign ad. If the presidents know that they are practically guaranteed the electoral votes by a state, why would they waste their time trying to persuade a state that is already persuaded? It makes sense for the candidates to see ""swing states""the states that are more divided, and whose electoral votes are not guaranteed one way or another. I don't blame the candidates for their methods, but the electoral college itself for bringing about these techniques for campaigning.

The last problem with the electoral college that I would like to address is how the electoral college discourages people from certain states from voting. For example, a Rebulican in California or a Democrat in Texas are obviously aware that their vote isn't going to count towards the majority of the state's votes, or to which candidate the state's electoral votes will be going to. People are definitely more likely to vote if they know that their vote will be heard in some way. The ""winner takes all"" method is eliminating any representation of the opposing party's vote and discourages the minority of the state from voting. Everyone says that being a good citizen requires being aware and involved with government decisions, and voting whenever possible, yet in the 2012 election, onehalf of Americans that were eligible to vote, did not. I'm sure that a good portion of nonvoters were influenced by the unfair ways of the electoral college.

As you can see, the electoral college brings about many issuesissues that could be easily avoided if the electoral college was changed to the much simpler and straight forward popular voting system. Our country would be accurately represented, people would feel as if their vote actually makes a difference, presidential campaign would be consistent for all states, and we would actually be able to vote for the specific person we are trying to vote for in the first place. With all of these reasons been said, I think it is pretty clear that the electoral college should be abolished, and that government should change to election of the president of the United States simply by popular vote.",0,"Florida Senator I have not know much about the electoral college until now and I be appalled that this election process have be use ever since the establishment of the Constitutiondecades ago the electoral college be unfair raise dispute do not provide an accurate representation of the country 's vote as a whole and the process be simply not logical I feel like we as a country could avoid a great deal of dispute that arise regard the electoral college voting system if it be change to election by popular vote

4,0,"Cars are a wonderful thing. They are perhaps one of the worlds greatest advancements and technologies. Cars get us from point a to point i. That is exactly what we want isnt it? We as humans want to get from one place to anther as fast as possiile. Cars are a suitaile to do that. They get us across the city in a matter of minutes. Much faster than anyhting else we have. A train isnt going to get me across the city as fast as my car is and neither is a puilic ius, iut those other forms of transportation just might ie the way to go. Don't get me wrong, cars are an aisolutly amazing thing iut, mayie they just cause way to much stress, and mayie they hurt our environment in ways that we don't think they will. With a ius or a train you do not have to worry aiout washing your car or getting frustrated when stuck in a iad traffic jam on I4. Also there is not as much pollution in air hurting our environment. You might not think so, iut there are many advantages to limiting our car usage.

One advantage that not only humans would ienefit from, iut also plants and animals is that there would ie a lot less pollution in the air hurting out environment. Right now our cars give off gases that are extremely harmful towards our environment. These gases are called green house gases and come out of the exhaust pipes in our cars. Your car alone docent give off much gas iut collectively, our cars give off enormous amounts of gases. This is especially true in iig cities like France. In France, their pollution level was so high it was record ireaking. due to that france decided to enforce a partial ian on cars. This is descriied in the second article "" Paris ians driving due to smog"", iy Roiert Duffer, "" On Monday motorists with evennumiered license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumiered plates the following day."" After France limited driving there congestion was down iy 60 percent. "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"". So after five days of intense smog, 60 percent of it was clear after not using cars for only a little while. Even across the world in Bogota, columiia they are limiting driving and reducing smog levels. In the third article ""carfree day is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota"", iy Andrew Selsky, it descriies the annual carfree day they have to reduce smog. "" the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"". So all over the world people are relizing that without cars, we are insuring the safety and well ieing of our environment.

The second advantage that would come with limiting car use is less stress. Everyone knows that driving a car causes emence amounts of stress. Getting caught in traffic is a major cause of stress in someones life. having to repeating wash your car just to get it dirt again causes stress. Having people in the iack of your car screaming and yelling all while music is ilasting, causes stress. So oiviously driving causes stress. If we were to limit our car usage we would not ie as stressed as we usually are. There would ie no traffic, no car washes and no one screaming in a small confineded space. In the first article "" In German Suiuri, life goes on without cars"", iy Elisaieth Rosenthal, a citizen named humdrum Walter, states "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". So with out the stress of a car humdrum Walter is a looser and happier person, less stress equals happier person. In the third article, "" Carfree dai is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota"", iy Andrew Selsky, it states "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."". If we have the opportunity to take away stress, why not take it. It is a huge advantage in our lives to limit driving if it takes away stress. No one wants stress, no one needs stress, and if we have an opportunity to take some of the stress away, take that opportunity.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car use, one ieing theat we get to help the environment and two ieing that it helps reduce stress. Our environment is already screwed up in so many ways, if we can help it to iecome the healthy environment it once was, then do it. Stress is proven to impare your personal health, no one wants to ie unhealthy and no one wants stress in their life. If you want the environment to get ietter and you want to reduce stress in your life then take this advantage and impliment it.

1631,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This is increasingly becoming a global trend, as countries and communities recognize the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable living. The passage set provides examples from various cities and regions that have implemented measures to limit car usage and reap the benefits.

One primary advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with Europe seeing 12 percent and some areas in the United States up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting alternative transportation methods, such as walking, biking, and public transportation, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and contribute to a cleaner environment.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to a decrease in traffic congestion. The passage describes how Paris implemented a driving ban due to smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This not only improves air quality but also improves the efficiency of transportation in cities. With fewer cars on the road, public transportation can operate more smoothly, allowing people to reach their destinations faster.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to healthier and more vibrant communities. The passage on Vauban, Germany, highlights the benefits of creating car-free neighborhoods. In this community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. Residents enjoy the peace and quiet of car-free streets, with the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children replacing the noise of motors. This promotes an active lifestyle, as walking and biking become the primary modes of transportation. It also creates a sense of community, as people have more opportunities to interact with each other while walking or cycling.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for economic savings. The passage mentions that Vauban only allows for two places to park cars, which cost $40,000 each. While this may seem costly, it can lead to long-term savings for individuals and communities. By relying less on cars, people can save money on fuel, insurance, maintenance, and parking fees. Additionally, communities can invest the money saved from parking spaces in creating more pedestrian-friendly spaces, improving public transportation systems, and developing amenities like parks and sports centers.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and communities. It can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease traffic congestion, promote healthier lifestyles, and lead to economic savings. The passage set provides examples from various cities and regions that have embraced these advantages and implemented measures to limit car usage. As the world continues to prioritize sustainability and environmental responsibility, it is crucial for more communities to consider limiting car usage for a better future.",1,"advantage of limit car usage

671,0,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage, for example, it lowers the amount of emmisons present in the atmosphere which can lead to a better planet. All around the world people have started using cars less and less because of the problems they cause, such as pollution and traffic, and have started moving to a better idea of society where everyone lives in a closer area with stores and jobs within walking distance. The life of cars is ending but our life is just getting better.

Since the times of World War 2, people have had the idea of spreadout homes and private garages but with new times come new ideas, new ideas of closer centered, compact cities. These new cities would have most shops and businesses in close quarters with housing to reduce the need for automobiles and have walking as a more reliable mode of transportation as well as a small amount of public transportation to assist with the more lengthy distances between home and work. In this new approach stores are placed closer to home along walkways rather than in malls along highways in the distance. This would reduce the space needed for the shopping centers as well due to the fact that they would no longer need large parking lots for all the vehicles that were once needed to commute to and fro.

Emissions and greenhouse gases have been a problem in modern society due to the fact that almost everyone has an automobile. This has been creating a large amount of stress on the environment and can lead to problems in the near future. Because of these problems, many environmental agencies have started regulating car usage to try to keep the environment safe. Some of the ways they are doing this include promoting ""car reduced"" communities, which rely more on public transportation serving the suburbs than personal transportation. This helps to cut down on traffic and in turn the amount of emissions produced by cars on the road. Another way to prevent this is to ban the act of driving all together. Paris has done this in the past to combat the amount of smog accumulating in their city by banning the driving of certain license plate numbers which reduced the amount of traffic and emissions.

Car free cities are also very popular. an example of this is Bogota, Columbia. They have had cars banned for the last three years, minus buses and taxis. The goal of this project was to promote alternate means of transportation and reduce smog. This has created over 118 miles in bicycle paths as well as broad smooth sidewalks. The amount has traffic has also been cut in half during rushhour thanks to new restrictions. New restaurants and upscale shopping has also come up all around the area. The amount of smag has also been reduced significantly and air quality has made a huge jump.

Overall, the age of the car is coming to an end, but it is making our life better and easier. Hopefully these new restrictions and ideas will help us to reduce smog, cut down on traffic and produce a better, more stressfree, lifestyle.

1008,0,"The world is facing incredibly drastic climate change due to car emissions and power plants, both are burning fossil fuels. Things may look bad, almost irreversible but the sun has not yet set, there's hope and it comes in the shape of a shifting world wide attitude towards vehicles. Governments are focusing on making green zones designed to limit car use. There are a plethora of positive effects that this may have on society. Reducing the temperature of a rapidly heating planet will allow us to savour our oceans rather than running from them as they grow to envelop our costal cities. It will relieve stress from those who had been trapped in a car all day and last, but not least, it's not difficult and one wont be alone in their endeavors.

To begin, cars emit green house gasses which will accumulate in our atmosphere trapping heat underneath it as it tries to leave our planet. This leads to a cumulative effect that causes the earth's average temperature to rise. In Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Elizabeth Rosenthal says ""Green house gas emitions from cars in America make up fifty percent of all greenhouse gas emitions in the country."" America barely has any regulations in relation to greenhouse gas emitions to start with but this is crazy. This problem could be easily solved with a few regulations and some smart city planning. The benefits of this includes but is not limited to, more temperate climate, less airborne carcinogens and of course no crazy drivers.

Another good reason to switch is riding a bike or travelling on a train or bus is much more relaxing than rapidly driving down the highway being cut off by rude drivers and endangering yourself simply by merging. instead you can leisurely wait to arrive at your destination. In German Suburb Elisabeth Rosenthal writes a quote from an interview which says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier now."" This media trainer said this as she walked the streets of Verdant ""where the swish of bicycles and chatter of wandering children drowned out the occasional distant motor."" This is beautiful, borderline serene, only a crazy person would disagree with such an environment.

Now traveling all the way across the world, from Germany to Columbia. These countries are both spearheading the experiments with pollution reduction and in Bogata The capital of Columbia, they actually organize ""Car free days"" seven million people in Bogota alone participated in the event, violaters would even have to pay a 25 fine. According to Andrew Selsky, the author of Car Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogoto, ""Even the rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" It seems that, rightfully, this event is treated as a celebration and it has great effects on the environment.

In conclusion these every one should follow suit with this beautiful and healthy way of tackling environmental issues.

 now travel all the way across the world from Germany to Columbia these country be both spearhead the experiment with pollution reduction and in Bogata the capital of Columbia they actually organize car free day seven million people in Bogota alone participate in the event violater would even have to pay a 25 fine accord to Andrew Selsky the author of Car Free Day be spin into a big hit in Bogoto even the rain have n't stop people from participate it seem that rightfully this event be treat as a celebration and it have great effect on the environment 

 in conclusion these every one should follow suit with this beautiful and healthy way of tackle environmental issue if people stay on track it will be easy fun relaxing and the Earth will be admire for many year to come"

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my thoughts and concerns regarding the Electoral College and whether it should be retained or changed to a popular vote system in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information presented in the provided texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept for the following reasons:

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is typically higher than their share of the popular vote, ensuring a clear victor. This helps to avoid political gridlock and potential legal battles that could arise from close popular vote margins.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is ""everyone's President,"" as Judge Posner points out. With its requirement for trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents candidates with only regional favoritism from winning the presidency. This is crucial in a diverse nation like ours because a president elected via popular vote may not necessarily represent the interests and concerns of all regions equally. By requiring broad support across multiple states, the Electoral College ensures that the President governs with a national perspective.

Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. One of the main criticisms of the Electoral College is that it leads to candidates exclusively focusing on a few swing states during their campaigns. However, this also means that voters in those crucial states receive the most attention and information from the candidates. These voters are likely to be more informed and thoughtful, which ultimately benefits the democratic process.

Fourthly, the Electoral College provides a balance of power for big states. It is no secret that large states hold significant political influence due to their population size. However, the Electoral College allows smaller states to have a proportional say by granting them more electoral votes per capita. This prevents large states from dominating the political landscape and ensures that candidates must appeal to a diverse range of states and communities during their campaigns.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. With this system in place, there is a reduced likelihood of multiple candidates running with no clear majority winner. This eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections, allowing for a smoother transition of power and maintaining the stability of the presidential election process.

While some argue that a popular vote system would be more fair and democratic, it is important to consider the potential disadvantages. As mentioned in Bradford Plumer's article, a popular vote system could lead to a disastrous outcome, such as when state legislatures have the power to select electors. It also has the potential to disenfranchise voters in regions that have no chance of electing a president, leading to a decrease in voter turnout.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College provides an effective and balanced method of electing the President of the United States. It ensures certainty of outcome, prevents regional favoritism, encourages candidates to appeal to a broader range of states, balances power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While no system is perfect, the Electoral College offers greater stability and representation for all citizens. Therefore, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh the information provided and make the best decision for our state and our nation.

645,1,"This country is built on democracy, the idea that all of its citizens have rights and a say in how the country is run. The Electoral College takes away the peoples vote, because in an election, the eligible citizens vote for a candidate, but in reality they are voting for a group of electors who will then vote for the candidate. I believe this is unfair and that the Electoral College should be removed from the country's government.

The first flaw with the Electoral College is that voters cannot directly vote for their favorite candidate. In Source 2 paragraph 10 , it says "" ... voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

"" If citizens of the United States can't vote for their own president directly then it takes some of the democracy out of the country. It rarely happens but the electors don't always vote for the candidate with the most popular vote, they can vote for whoever they want, if they really wanted to. This is just one reason I think the Electoral College should be removed, and replaced by a popular vote.

My next reason for replacing the Electoral College with a popular vote is that a tie in the Electoral College is possible. In Source 3 paragraph 18 , it says "" A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538is an even number...

"" If a tie occurs then the vote goes to the House of Representatives, but how will they know the feelings of voters if they vote one party for Congress, and another party for president?

My final reason to get rid of the Electoral College is that a candidate can win the popular vote, but lose the election. In Source 2 paragraph 9 , it says ""...

Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the poular vote but lost the presidency...

"" If the people's favorite candidate wins the popular vote, a vote representing the country's citizens, but loses the election because of the Electoral College then the system is unfair to voters.

Source 3 paragraph 19 , "" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to select a president.

"" But this country should be about how the people vote, a popular vote would be the same, no region would have enough eligeable voters to elect a president, so a candidate would have to campaign all over the country.

In conclusion I think the Electoral College should be replaced with a popular vote. Voters cannot directly vote for thier choice candidate, ties can occur in the Electoral College, and a candidate can win the popular vote, but somehow still lose the election.",0,"this country be build on democracy the idea that all of its citizen have right and a say in how the country be run the Electoral College take away the people vote because in an election the eligible citizen vote for a candidate but in reality they be vote for a group of elector who will then vote for the candidate I believe this be unfair and that the Electoral College should be remove from the country 's government

1698,0,"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages, both for individuals and for society as a whole. One of the main benefits is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and contribute to efforts to combat climate change.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also lead to improved public health. The passage set mentions that smog in Paris was so severe that it rivaled Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The poor air quality caused by car emissions can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. By reducing car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier environments for people to live in.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for more efficient use of space. The passage set mentions the development of the Vauban community in Germany, where car ownership is allowed but limited parking spaces are provided. This results in more compact living spaces and frees up land that would have been used for parking. By reducing the need for parking spaces and encouraging the use of public transportation and walking, we can create more livable communities with less congestion and more green spaces.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage set mentions that delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban, but exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This shows that promoting alternative modes of transportation can encourage the adoption of more fuel-efficient vehicles and create economic opportunities in industries related to these vehicles.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more equitable transportation options. The passage set mentions that car ownership started to decline in the United States two to three years before the economic downturn, indicating that something more fundamental was happening. This could be due to changing cultural attitudes towards cars and a desire for more sustainable and affordable transportation options.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improved public health, more efficient use of space, economic benefits, and more equitable transportation options. As the passage set demonstrates, there are already successful examples of communities and cities implementing measures to limit car usage. By adopting similar measures and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1,"limit car usage have numerous advantage both for individual and for society as a whole one of the main benefit be the reduction of greenhouse gas emission and air pollution accord to the passage set passenger car be responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive area in the United States by limit car usage we can significantly reduce these emission and contribute to effort to combat climate change

542,1,"Dear, Senator I think the president should be elected by popular vote not electors. Heres some reasons why i think the president should be voted by popular vote and not electors.

One reason is when you vote for your president your actually voting for the presidents elector. So basically your not voting fot a president your voting for a elector that votes for you. After the election the government prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" a certificate of ascertainment is a listing of all the candidates who ran for president along with the names of there electors. The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning president and which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the elector in december of election year.

Another reason is more people would rather abolish electoral college. Electoral college is dumb because there was a gallop poll in 2000 taken shortly afte Al Gore. In the poll Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the electoral college. In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, Bush received 271 electoral votes and Gore received 266. Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors. Who can be electors? It can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state, sometimes state conventions, sometimes state partys central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates.

Last but not least the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 segregationnists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their partys candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please. What happens if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponents electors. The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote in that case the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president and The Senate would choose the vicepresident. Each state only casts one vote that means the single representatives from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have as much say as California who represents 35 million voters. An electoral tie seems unlikely think of this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976 a tie would have occurred if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted differently. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

What im trying to say is the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all including Rhode island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaigh ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrartional. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions. Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college.",0,"dear Senator I think the president should be elect by popular vote not elector here some reason why I think the president should be vote by popular vote and not elector

1381,0,"In our dynamic and ever-expanding cities, the question of limiting car usage has emerged as a critical concern with profound implications for both individuals and society as a whole. Examining multiple sources reveals compelling advantages in areas such as environmental sustainability, public health, and urban planning. By reducing our reliance on cars, we not only address immediate issues but also contribute to a more sustainable and harmonious future.

One of the pivotal advantages of limiting car usage lies in its positive impact on the environment. According to a comprehensive report from the International Energy Agency, the transportation sector is a major contributor to global carbon emissions, with automobiles being a significant part of the problem. Transitioning to alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or cycling, represents a proactive step towards mitigating climate change. The report emphasizes the urgent need for sustainable practices, indicating that a reduction in car usage can substantially contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and fostering environmental resilience.

Furthermore, the consequences of vehicular emissions extend beyond climate concerns to public health. Research compiled by the World Health Organization underscores the adverse effects of air pollution from cars, linking it to respiratory diseases and other health issues. Limiting car usage becomes not just an environmental imperative but also a public health necessity. By embracing cleaner transportation options, we can significantly improve air quality, reducing the prevalence of respiratory ailments and enhancing overall well-being. This interconnectedness between transportation choices and public health underscores the importance of reevaluating our dependence on cars.

In addition to environmental and health considerations, the advantages of limiting car usage extend to urban planning. The Urban Land Institute's research highlights the need for sustainable urban development, emphasizing that prioritizing pedestrians and alternative transportation options is integral to creating livable cities. By investing in public transit infrastructure and designing pedestrian-friendly spaces, cities can alleviate traffic congestion and create more efficient, pleasant urban environments. This approach not only enhances the quality of life for residents but also aligns with a broader vision of urban development that emphasizes sustainability and community well-being.

While concerns about inconvenience and economic impact may arise, it is crucial to recognize the long-term benefits of limiting car usage. The evidence from multiple sources overwhelmingly supports the idea that transitioning away from exclusive reliance on cars is a multifaceted solution. As responsible citizens, we are tasked with understanding the broader implications of our transportation choices and actively participating in the collective effort to create a more sustainable and resilient future.",1,"in our dynamic and ever expand city the question of limit car usage have emerge as a critical concern with profound implication for both individual and society as a whole examine multiple source reveal compelling advantage in area such as environmental sustainability public health and urban planning by reduce our reliance on car we not only address immediate issue but also contribute to a more sustainable and harmonious future

32,1,"Voting. Voting is a pretty big deal that only comes around so many years. And with voting the citizens of the U.S. have a voice. And also the voting method in which the president is elected by popular votes is just fine and it should be the only way people vote for their president. No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them. The popular is just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method is more fair than the electoral college voting method. Secondly, the popular vote for president is less complicated, where as the electoral college can cause complications and problems.

To start off, the popular vote for president is more fair than the electoral college. First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country.

Next, the popular vote for president is less complicated, unlike the electoral college where complications, problems, and just a big mess could happen. With the popular vote it is pretty straight forward and simple. The people vote for whom ever they want to be their next president and serve the country, the votes get counted up and whoever has the most votes gets to be the new president. But with the electoral college if a tie had occured as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.The Senate would choose the vicepresident. Because each state casts only one vote, the single from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" Now that sure seems to be complicated. Just one vote represents 500,000 or 35 million voters. The popular vote method is a lot more simple it doesn't require all of these steps. With the popular vote everyone votes and the majority of the votes is the winner, as simple as that. It doesn't require going to the representatives who vote for themselves and a whole bunch of other people as well.

In conclusion, the popular vote method is better because it is more fair. It gives people a voice to choose for whom ever they want not what anybody else wants. Also, the popular vote method is a whole lot less complicated than the electoral college. Where if there is a tie the representatives vote for themselves and are also representing thousands of other people who may or may not want that specific candidate to be president. So voting is no joke it is serious and it shouldn't be taken as a joke either. Every person should have a voice they should be able to vote for who ever they desire. No one else should be able to vote for them, not even the representatives. Voting is no joke.",0,"vote voting be a pretty big deal that only come around so many year and with vote the citizen of the U.S. have a voice and also the voting method in which the president be elect by popular vote be just fine and it should be the only way people vote for their president no one else should vote for they the people have the right to choose who ever they want and no one have the right to vote for any other person but they the popular be just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method be more fair than the electoral college voting method secondly the popular vote for president be less complicated where as the electoral college can cause complication and problem

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to continue to uphold this system for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue for a switch to a popular vote system, I believe there are significant advantages to keeping the Electoral College intact.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. This system minimizes the possibility of disputes over the election results, as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College would typically exceed their share of the popular vote. This was evident in the 2012 election when President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. In addition, the winner-take-all nature of most states' allocation of electoral votes leads to landslide victories, reducing the possibility of a tied electoral vote.

Another compelling reason to maintain the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, meaning that candidates must have trans-regional appeal in order to win. This is crucial for a successful presidency, as it ensures that all residents, regardless of their region, feel that their voices are heard and that the President will consider their interests.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which increases engagement and attention from voters. In a winner-take-all system, candidates focus on toss-up states, leading to more thoughtful and well-informed voters who make crucial decisions for the nation as a whole. This focus on swing states ensures that candidates address the concerns and needs of a diverse range of voters, rather than solely catering to regions that are already in their favor.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large states. While the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate may result in a loss of weight for large states, the Electoral College provides them with a mechanism to regain some political significance. This is exemplified by the fact that a close popular vote in a large state like Florida can result in 29 electoral votes, whereas the same margin of victory in a smaller state like Wyoming would only yield 3 electoral votes. By giving large states more attention during the campaign process, the Electoral College ensures a fair representation of their interests.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, preventing complications and uncertainties that arise when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. Instead, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, avoiding the need to prolong the election process with additional rounds of voting.

While critics argue that the Electoral College discourages potential voters in non-competitive states, it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains significant despite knowing that their vote may not swing the outcome on a national level. Voters participate in elections to express their political preference, and their engagement is driven by their desire to have their stance represented, rather than the belief that a single vote may decide the entire election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, ensures trans-regional representation, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the political influence of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While a popular vote system may seem appealing at first glance, the Electoral College has proven to be effective in ensuring fair and balanced presidential elections throughout history. I urge you to maintain and defend this essential democratic process for the benefit of our great nation.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I greatly appreciate your dedication to serving our state and country.

308,0,"To my fellow citizens all across the world I think there are a lot of advantages that come with the limited car usage. One thing is that it could save the environment from the pollution of gas. Also it could save people a whole lot of money if they didn't have a car. Lastly and final statement why limited car usage is advantage is that they use the money from the car to buy homes.

For starters, their are a lot of things that come with buying a car but a lot of people dont no is that every time they start up there car their actually hurting the environment because of the gas. Here is an example from source 2.""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". After reading that it seems to me that the pollution of the gas is becoming to be a problem all around the world and thats why we need to put a stop to it by just banning it for country to country and then eventually become a car free world. Another example I found from source 2. ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". I read that and i was like wow! I wonder why that might be well if they banned the car usage they might bring do there pollution or congestion in the city. Thats why the pollution from the gas is so bad it could actually harm or maybe possibly kill them if they breathe in that pollution on a consistent basis.

Secondly, people make pretty big sacrifices in life but one I found most interesting was that Germany residents were selling there cars to buy homes for them to live in. This strikes my eye in very many ways is that they are saving an expense they don't need and also saving the environment also. For example, in source 1 it said ""70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here"". I find that quite interesting why a family like that would just give up transportation and then I thought well they save a ton of money and also they get to move to maybe a better living environment just by limiting the car usage. People who live in Levittown, New York are good example of limited car usage because a lot of them work in the city and a lot of times driving into the city is not a very good thing to do because of the traffic. So what do they do? They don't drive a car but only to the train station were they ride the train to and from the city saving money in gas and its easier to do it that way.

Thirdly, citizens use limited car usage to save money in life because lets all face it the world we live in is tough money is hard to come by and people have car payments they have to pay every month and sometimes they cant make that payment cause they have other bills they have to pay so what do they do. They sell they car and that gives them extra money a month to pay for bills a such forth. Another thing they save from selling there car is that they don't have to pay for gas either so your probably saving some where around 200 hundred dollars in cash or credit in one month which is good. Thats another reason why selling your car is an advantage of limited car usage.

In conclusion, their are a lot of ways where citizens of the world can use limiting there car usage as an advantage. Where it might be saving the environment or selling your vehicle to buy a home or even maybe just to save money in everyday life like some citizens do in Levittown, New York. These were some of my opinions on advantages of limiting car usage in everyday life.",0,"to my fellow citizen all across the world I think there be a lot of advantage that come with the limited car usage one thing be that it could save the environment from the pollution of gas also it could save people a whole lot of money if they did n't have a car lastly and final statement why limited car usage be advantage be that they use the money from the car to buy home

919,0,"Everyone has at less had one car in there life time no matter how yes it was or how old or ragidy it was it was a car that was poluting our air and giving off greenhouse gas. Now I would now what i whould do with out my car but then again there are some benefits or advantages you would have if you didn own a car.

We can start off on now much money you would save if you did have a car. Think about gas is about what 2.99 now right? Or lets just say your driving minding your own bessnious and some edit rams in the back of your new Nisson 2015 car and oh lord i dont think you want to talk about how high you insurgents would go up. People in Vaudan and in most of France don't even have cars 70 percent to be exact. Now its not like a law that they can't have veicals just lot of people choose not to have one. How ever if you do own a car you will have pretty much no where to put it. Street parking,driveways and home garages are actually forbidden in some areas. If you still really really want your car you have only two places to put it. One in a large parking garage at the edge of the development or two you can buy a space for 40,000 along with a home. If you never had a car you wouldn't have to spend all that money on gas,insurgents,getting your car repairedfixed,and a parking spot. That's why 57 percent of people sold there car when they moved to Vauba.

The biggest advantage you would have if you didn own a car is that you will be giving back to mother earth. Cars are responsible for 12 perect of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. Cars can also be more stress then there worth having. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. What do you think scards you the most when your dive? Getting in a car crash and seriousaly injuring yourself or worse die on inpacked right? Why don't you save the stress and the fear. Just give up you car. I know what your think what if i work far away etc? Just take the bus or better yet ride a bike to where ever you need to go or walk get some exercise and brake a little sweat. Or just take one day that we all not us own cars to just see how life would be. That's how BOGOTA got started in Colombia. They have been going it for 3 straight years. There are 7 million cizins people walked,hiked,and even skated. The only vehicals that where permitted where buses and taxis and if it rained it didn't stop them participating. Why can't we do that just for one day? If everyone just took one day that using cars I think i would make a big change.

There are many advantages we all would have if we all didn't have a car but I know it will take time for all of us to make that disitoin but hopful its soom before its to late for us and for the world.",0,"everyone have at less have one car in there life time no matter how yes it be or how old or ragidy it be it be a car that be polute our air and give off greenhouse gas now I would now what I whould do with out my car but then again there be some benefit or advantage you would have if you didn own a car

Subject: In Support of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for retaining the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital and necessary component of our democratic process. In this letter, I will present several reasons based on the information provided in the passages to support my claim.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. As we have seen in previous elections, the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This serves to create a clear and decisive victory, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election results (Posner, 18). Furthermore, the winner-take-all method employed by most states ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory, making ties in the nationwide electoral vote highly improbable (Posner, 18).

Another important advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president is a representative of the entire nation and not just certain regions. Candidates must have trans-regional appeal to secure enough electoral votes for victory. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning the popular vote in specific regions, which may result in a president who only prioritizes the interests of a specific area while disregarding others (Posner, 19). By requiring candidates to appeal to a diverse range of states, the Electoral College ensures that the president is genuinely ""everyone's president.""

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which are instrumental in deciding the election outcomes. Swing states receive significant attention, as candidates recognize the importance of winning their electoral votes. This mechanism compels candidates to engage with voters in these states, resulting in more informed and thoughtful voters who play a decisive role in the election (Posner, 20). This focus on swing states leads to a more competitive and engaging electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance to the political power held by large and small states. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate may result in a disparity in the political influence of states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates pay attention to both large and small states during their campaigns. In this way, the Electoral College offsets the potential imbalance caused by the Senate's structure, ensuring that states of all sizes have their concerns and interests addressed by presidential candidates (Posner, 21).

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This eliminates the potential complications and additional expenses associated with such elections. Instead, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner with a majority of electoral votes, thus maintaining stability in the election process (Posner, 22).

While some critics argue that the Electoral College discourages voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it should be noted that voter participation remains high despite this factor (Posner, 23). Voters are motivated to express their political preferences, even if they understand that their vote may not swing a national election. The high turnout in presidential elections demonstrates a continued commitment to participating in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system of electing the President of the United States. It provides certainty of outcomes, ensures a president who represents the entire nation, encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. These advantages outweigh the arguments for changing to a popular vote system. I respectfully urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College in our electoral process.

Thank you for considering my perspective. I look forward to your continued dedication to representing the interests of our state and our nation.

310,0,"Many people believe that it is necessary to use a car to get from one place to another. Many studies have shown that this in fact is not true. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. I am in favor of limiting car usage because of the advantages it brings to the world. One reason to limit car usage is, because it reduces the amount of pollution. Another reason, is because many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage. Lastly, limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. Beneficial and critical, limiting car usage helps humans as well as the environment.

First of all, limiting car usage reduces the amount of pollution worldwide. Reflective and didactic, Robert Fuller's ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" reflects the amount of pollution that is reduced due to limited car usage. For example, Robert Fuller explains that ""...Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" This statement layers Robert's opinion that car usage can create vast amounts of pollution. If car usage is limited, the amount of particulate matter would decrease. For instance, this theory is created when Robert Fuller states ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Another reason, is because many people around the world are in favor. appalled and enthusiastic, Andrew Selsky's ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", molds the theory that limiting car usage has many advantages. For instance, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife. The fact that many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage is shown, when Andrew Selsky sates that ""Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic."" Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus is also in favor as he states ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" These statements show that limiting car usage is very beneficial and has many advantages.

Lastly, limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. This is shown in Elisabeth Rosenthal's ""The End of Car Culture."" Elisabeth states that ""...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" Elisabeth Rosenthal also states that ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions just behind power plants."" Limiting car usage also improves safety. Last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering with telecommunications. Bill Ford wanted to partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" This statement forms the theory that limiting car usage has many advantages.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages. We as people of the world need to limit car usage for many reasons. The first reason is, because it reduces the amount of pollution. The second reason is that many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage. The last reason is, because limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. This is why we as citizens of the world need to limit car usage worldwide.",0,"many people believe that it be necessary to use a car to get from one place to another many study have show that this in fact be not true there be many advantage to limit car usage I be in favor of limit car usage because of the advantage it bring to the world one reason to limit car usage be because it reduce the amount of pollution another reason be because many people around the world be in favor of limit car usage lastly limit car usage lower emission and improve safety beneficial and critical limit car usage help human as well as the environment

207,1,"The Electoral College has been a part of America since the beginning, but is it fair? Our country is a Democracy, which means "" For the People"" or "" By the People"". The Electoral College is not By the People. Yes, it has historical value, but it no longer is what a Democracy is because of population changes and states being added to the country.

To begin with, Source 2 states "" The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state."" There is a popularity vote and then the Electoral College vote, most citizens think that the popularity vote will win because that candidate is the person that the people chose. That is not the case. It just depends on basically how big your state is and how popular a candidate is in that state. The population is the biggest factor that the candidates think about because if they win that state they are closer to winning the election. There are people who want to abolish the Electoral College including past presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. It really just isn't fair to the people that who they vote for and who wins the popular vote may not have a chance to win because heshe did not get the Electoral College votes.

In addition, Source 3 states "" The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electorss who vote for a president, no the people."" When you vote in your state you are actually voting for an electors and not the presidential candidate. In 2000 the popular vote was higher for Al Gore than it was for George Bush, but Bush won the presidential election because he had a higher number of electorss in the electorsal college. In a real democracy Gore would have won because of the fact he was more popular. The people want to vote directly for the candidate they want not for some person that has been trusted to vote for a party's nominee.

Finally, The Electoral College is kind of fair in a way because it is based off population in each state. There is also an equal number of electorss. Source 1 states "" The founding fathers established it the electorsal college in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens."" I understand that it is a law set by the men who created our country and it worked back then. It just isn't working in present day.

In conclusion, The Electoral College was created by the founding fathers back when the U.S. was small and didn't have a huge population like we do today. It worked back then, but now there are 50 states and millions of people. They want to be heard. The popular vote would make more sense than having states with huge populations deciding the fate of the election, when it should by popularity of the candidate. We need to restore our democracy and have the election be By the People.",0,"the Electoral College have be a part of America since the beginning but be it fair our country be a Democracy which mean for the People or by the People the Electoral College be not by the People yes it have historical value but it no long be what a democracy be because of population change and state be add to the country 

 to begin with source 2 state the Electoral College be unfair to voter because of the winnertakeall system in each state there be a popularity vote and then the Electoral College vote most citizen think that the popularity vote will win because that candidate be the person that the people choose that be not the case it just depend on basically how big your state be and how popular a candidate be in that state the population be the big factor that the candidate think about because if they win that state they be close to win the election there be people who want to abolish the Electoral College include past president Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter it really just be n't fair to the people that who they vote for and who win the popular vote may not have a chance to win because heshe do not get the Electoral College vote

1388,0,"In an era marked by environmental concerns, traffic congestion, and public health awareness, limiting car usage emerges as a viable and advantageous choice for citizens. Drawing insights from multiple sources, it becomes apparent that reducing reliance on personal vehicles not only addresses environmental issues but also contributes to improved urban living and individual well-being.

One compelling reason to limit car usage is the profound impact on the environment. According to a comprehensive report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), automobiles are significant contributors to air pollution, emitting pollutants like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. These emissions not only compromise air quality but also contribute to global climate change. Transitioning to alternative transportation methods, such as biking or utilizing public transit, can substantially reduce carbon footprints and actively combat the detrimental effects of vehicular pollution.

Beyond environmental considerations, limiting car usage offers a solution to the pervasive problem of urban congestion, as highlighted by the Urban Land Institute. Excessive reliance on personal vehicles leads to traffic jams, longer commute times, and heightened stress levels. By promoting and investing in alternative modes of transportation, cities can alleviate congestion, enhance mobility, and create more livable urban spaces. Efficient public transit systems, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and designated bike lanes are essential components of this shift towards sustainable transportation.

Furthermore, the advantages extend to public health, as emphasized by the World Health Organization (WHO). The sedentary lifestyle associated with prolonged car use is a major health risk, contributing to issues such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Encouraging citizens to adopt more active forms of transportation, such as walking or cycling, not only improves physical health but fosters a sense of community engagement. Shared public spaces become avenues for interaction, promoting both individual and collective well-being.

While acknowledging these advantages, it is crucial to recognize the challenges associated with limiting car usage. Infrastructure development, public policy initiatives, and community involvement are integral to facilitating this transition. Governments and local authorities play a pivotal role in creating an environment conducive to alternative transportation methods, ensuring accessibility, safety, and convenience for citizens.

In conclusion, limiting car usage stands as a multifaceted solution with benefits spanning environmental conservation, urban livability, and public health. As citizens, embracing alternative transportation methods and advocating for sustainable urban planning are powerful steps toward a healthier, more resilient future. The responsible limitation of car usage is not just an individual choice; it is a collective effort that contributes to the well-being of communities and the sustainability of our planet.",1,"in an era mark by environmental concern traffic congestion and public health awareness limit car usage emerge as a viable and advantageous choice for citizen draw insight from multiple source it become apparent that reduce reliance on personal vehicle not only address environmental issue but also contribute to improve urban living and individual well being

1039,1,"A president election is great but, there are some difficulties along the way of deciding who will be able to vote. People are asking themselves whether or not they should keep the electoral vote or get rid of it and have a popular voting method. To me, the popular voting method is reasonable. I believe that you should get rid of the electoral collage method and change it to the popular voting method because its fair to the voters, YOU are able to vote for the president of your choice, and because of the winnertakeall system. You need to think about everyone in the all the states not just electing your president. Your people need to agree with the choice that has been made.

The electoral collage should be changed to the popular voting method because it is unfair to the voters. everyone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decide ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is not fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn around and vote for the other person. In Source 2 ""The indefensible electoral college : why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer"" backs up my response when stating,""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.

With the popular voting method you are able to choose the president of your choice, not the president's electors. In doing this you are having a fair vote in the election with everyone who is eligible to vote, voting whomever they please. If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyone agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In Source 2 ""The indefensible electoral college : why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer"" it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that?

Another thing that is unfair in the election is the winnertakeall system in each state. People don't usually spend time in states they know the don't have a chance at winning. Who would? these states only focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Sometime around the 2000 campaign, apporximately 17 states didn't at all see those candidates. Even when there were voters in states that had 25 of the largest media markets, they were not able to see not even one ad from the campaign. This is being said in Source 2 ""The indefensible electoral college : why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer"" For my conclusion this proves that there are many difficulties along the way of an election, regarding the votes and voters. With this letter being written, people should not wonder whether or not the electoral college should be abolished, and go with the popluar voting method. You shouldn't be thinking about just a couple of people, but of a whole nation and deciding who is worthy enough in our eyes to lead us to more victories with the popular voting method.",0,"a president election be great but there be some difficulty along the way of decide who will be able to vote People be ask themselves whether or not they should keep the electoral vote or get rid of it and have a popular voting method to I the popular voting method be reasonable I believe that you should get rid of the electoral collage method and change it to the popular voting method because its fair to the voter you be able to vote for the president of your choice and because of the winnertakeall system you need to think about everyone in the all the state not just elect your president your people need to agree with the choice that have be make

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing this letter to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College system in presidential elections. While there are valid arguments to change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that should be considered. I have thoroughly analyzed the information from various sources and would like to present my case based on the texts provided.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome, which is less likely to be disputed compared to a popular vote system. As highlighted in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner of the Electoral College vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all approach in most states creates a landslide victory, minimizing the possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. This stability in outcome ensures that the election process does not suffer from prolonged uncertainty and potential disputes.

Another critical benefit of the Electoral College system is that it promotes the representation of all regions and discourages candidates from focusing solely on heavily populated areas. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, regional favorites without nationwide appeal are unlikely to be successful presidents. Under the Electoral College, candidates need to have trans-regional appeal to secure the necessary electoral votes for victory. This ensures that the president represents various regions of the country and takes into account the interests of all citizens, regardless of their geographical location.

The third advantage of the Electoral College system lies in its promotion of swing states. As mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's text, the winner-take-all approach incentivizes candidates to focus on competitive states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention, leading to better-informed and thoughtful decision-making. By concentrating campaign efforts in these states, candidates are more likely to engage with citizens, discuss important issues, and address the concerns of the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance regarding the influence of large states versus small states. Large states, as Bradford Plumer highlights in ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" receive more attention from presidential candidates due to their greater number of electoral votes. This helps prevent the political disadvantages that large states face as a consequence of the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate. By providing a larger political weight to large states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates must campaign across both large and small states, guaranteeing a more inclusive approach to the electorate.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid the need for run-off elections. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, reducing the pressure for additional elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This eliminates the complications and challenges associated with run-off elections and maintains the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College system can discourage some potential voters in states where their preferred candidate does not have a chance of winning, it is important to remember that the majority of eligible American citizens still exercise their right to vote in presidential elections. As voters, we express our political preferences and values, regardless of the potential impact of our individual votes on the national outcome. The Electoral College does not prevent citizens from engaging in the electoral process but ensures that all states and regions have a meaningful role in electing the president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, as established by our founding fathers, offers crucial benefits that should be taken into consideration. It promotes stability in election outcomes, encourages the representation of all regions, focuses campaigns on competitive swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. I respectfully request that you consider these points in your decision-making as you deliberate on the future of our electoral system.

Thank you for your time and attention. I trust that you will carefully consider the perspectives presented in this letter along with the information provided in the supporting texts. I look forward to witnessing your thoughtful determination on this matter that affects our democratic process.

1361,1,"Dear senator, I think that the presidential election should be settled by popular vote. We people are being run as a country by the president, and we should be able to have more of an impact choosing who our president will be.

The president currently gets chosen in the Electoral College, a process in which the electors vote for President and Vice President after they are selected. This process flows very well and the president is chosen easily, so its good. The Electoral Collage consists of 538 electors. The majority being 270 electoral votes and the first president to get to this number in the race wins. We the people are separated into states and the states get however many electoral votes based on population. So the bigger states get more say on who's President, but I mean that makes sense because more citizens live there. There are also many flaws with this process though, and thats why I think it should be settled by popular vote.

You may think that the people are mainly voting for the President in the Electoral Collage process, but we're not. The people just vote for electors who in turn elect the President. Some of the slates of electors may even vote for who they want to and forget about what the majority of the state wants. At the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnertakesall system in each state. This means that if say Florida has twentynine electoral votes, then all twentynine go to the candidate who wins that state. ""So normaly candidates don't spend time in states they know they have know chance of winning, focusing only on the ""swing states"" and the larger populated states."" ""Swing states"" are states that pay close attention to the campaign and really listen to the competing candidates. This means that the states may pick the republican or democrat. Some states pick the same way every election. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina. I mean what kind of madness is that, how are they supposed to know who to choose. Thats not fair and it shouldn't be settled that way. This all just proves that ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Therefore the Electoral Collage shouldn't be the way to elect the President and VicePresident and should be either altered or in my opinion scratched. So then they should be elected by popular vote, so we have more control on who runs the country.",0,"dear senator I think that the presidential election should be settle by popular vote we people be be run as a country by the president and we should be able to have more of an impact choose who our president will be

1239,0,"In your everyday life, just about anywhere you go you will see people traveling from place to place in their own vehicles. Is the idea of us, as individuals, not owning our own motor vehicles even an option? The idea of not being able to transport where you need to be when you need to be there is a terrifying thought. But, when put into consideration you will find it some what reasonable.

Just think about it, all the toxins released into the air and all the traffic we can be stuck in for hours at a time! Reducing the clutter and the use of oils is enfact very possible. Residents in Vauban, Germany have completely almost completly cut owing cars out of their community. 70 percent of vaughn's family don't own cars while 57 percent sold their cars to move there. With mostly ""carfree"" streets with the exception of the main thoroughfare, Vauban has forbidden driveways and home garages. Though car ownership is aloud if the car owner buys a space to park it, Vauban is leading an example of an alternative way that communities can live reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

This example has most certainly envulenced Paris enforcing a partial driving ban. pollution, a large issue in the streets of paris, is being reduced with a driving ban fining anyone who did not leave their cars at home. After five days of this ban, congestion in france was down 60 percent.

Though completely banning cars may be found inconfiniate or extreme, Bogota, colombia, takes place in this uprising craze by devoting one day a year to ""The Day Without Cars"". By doing this they strive to promote alternative transportation and reduce clutter in this capital city. Violators of this event would receive 25 fines. The community who participated in this event have found alternate transportation, and comfort in a break from the clutter. Businessman Carlos Arturo is quoted ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", he rode a twoseated bicycle with his wife to get from place to place. As more Colombian citied participate in the event Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the eveny and were enthusiastic. Enriqur Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, paraguay stated that ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"".

These changes are most certainly revolutionary and are changing the way we see our lifes and the way we see transportation. The idea of us working, learning, and living without indivisual automoblies is becoming to look like a huge possibilty. The fact that there are communties taking part in this act, reducing polution and clutter, show that this very well could be part of a change for us and the way we live. With the ownership of automobiles and drivers liscenses going down in america, Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilitier Research center, stated that ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift"".",0,"in your everyday life just about anywhere you go you will see people travel from place to place in their own vehicle be the idea of we as individual not own our own motor vehicle even an option the idea of not be able to transport where you need to be when you need to be there be a terrifying thought but when put into consideration you will find it some what reasonable

1273,0,"We don't need them if we all work together Car pool denser cities alts will be available public transit Sidewalks roads Convenients1l6 Better for uscan still interact without overdrivinginteractive bikingwalking online interaction Giving our cars up in this day and age seems impossible but if everyone can work together, new opportunities will arise that'll outweigh the convenience of having a personal vehicle. We won't need cars if we all work and cooperate with one another. Not only that but it'll become more cost effective and convenient as a whole in the long run. Once all is said and done, limiting car usage can only be positive.

Many questions would arise if this idea was approached, wouldn't we take longer to get places? Isn't it inconvenient and a stepback from personal commuting? The answer would be yes, but for the most part it's the point. Sure you make take longer to get places by car pooling or taking public transit, but if anyone is doing it there'll be no comparison of time with personal commuting, personal commuting will be gone. If no cars were available cities would compensate with free bikes when commuting or public transit. The nocar weekend in Paris allowed free public transit, so in the longterm it'd also be free Source 2. City planning would be modified to compensate for the increased commuting time making the long commutes a little easier. If we all work together we won't need cars, and in the end it'd be positive overall.

In a world of reduced personal commuting, the cost of living would improve as well. Money spent on gas or car maintenance would be nonexistent. Instead of using taxes on expensive roads, they'll be used on inexpensive sidewalks, just like in Bogota Source 3. With the extra cash from no car expenses it'll be easier to purchase luxury items you may want. Cities will be made with convenience in mind, placing key stores in easily accessible areas, similarly to vaughn's store placement Source 1. This would answer the question of inconvenience, A ten minute drive can become a ten minute bike or walk with strategic placement. In the end, a reduced car usage society would be more cost effective and convenient, a definite positive compared to an automobile society.

Cars are definitely important to many people, but only because the majority have cars. Take everyone's cars away and they wouldn't have a reason to need one. If we all work together we won't need cars, people will help one another and cities would be planned better. In this society you'd have more money to use as you please, instead of using it to survive. Most important of all, the time to take a car someplace rather than any other alternative would be the same important locations can always relocate for everyone's convenience.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in presidential elections. While some argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is crucial for several reasons outlined in the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In recent history, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College has always exceeded their share of the popular vote, thus minimizing the likelihood of a dispute over the final result. Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, which would lead to a more complex resolution process. These factors contribute to stability and confidence in the electoral process.

Moreover, the Electoral College system ensures that the President represents all regions of the country. By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the system promotes inclusivity and prevents candidates from solely focusing on regions where they have a strong local support base. This ultimately ensures that the President considers the interests of all citizens, regardless of their geographical location.

The Electoral College also provides an opportunity for swing states to have a significant impact on elections. Toss-up states receive heightened attention from candidates, resulting in more engaged and informed voters. This means that the most thoughtful voters, who have received ample information from the candidates, can directly influence the election outcome. This system promotes an informed electorate and encourages candidates to address the concerns of diverse communities.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances power between large and small states. While mal-apportionment of the Senate can lead to disproportionate representation in Congress, the Electoral College compensates for this disparity. It ensures that large states receive more attention from candidates, considering their larger populations, while still providing a voice to small states. This balance is crucial for maintaining an equitable representation and preventing a concentration of power in certain regions.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. By producing a clear winner even when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, it simplifies the election process and avoids potential complications. This allows for a smooth transition of power and ensures that the President can govern with a mandate from the people.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in our democratic system. By providing a certainty of outcome, ensuring regional representation, promoting engagement in swing states, balancing power between large and small states, and avoiding run-off elections, it upholds the principles of fairness and stability in our presidential elections. I strongly urge you to consider the significance of these factors as you deliberate on any potential changes to our electoral process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I appreciate your dedicated service to our state and country.

Sincerely,

1426,0,"In recent years, the idea of limiting car usage has gained momentum as a means to address various societal and environmental challenges. This essay will explore the advantages of reducing our reliance on cars, drawing insights from various sources. By doing so, we can better understand the multifaceted benefits that such a shift can bring.

Firstly, limiting car usage contributes significantly to environmental preservation. According to a study conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency, cars are a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, which are primary contributors to climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can mitigate the negative impact on air quality and work towards a more sustainable future.

Moreover, limiting car usage promotes public health. The American Journal of Public Health highlights that decreased car dependency is associated with increased physical activity. Encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, or the use of public transit can contribute to a healthier population by reducing sedentary lifestyles and associated health risks.

Economically, there are also advantages to be gained. A report from the International Energy Agency suggests that reducing car usage can lead to cost savings in terms of infrastructure maintenance and healthcare expenditures related to air pollution-related illnesses. Funds saved in these areas can be redirected towards more sustainable and socially beneficial projects, thereby enhancing overall societal well-being.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can alleviate traffic congestion, a problem that plagues many urban areas. The World Economic Forum notes that congestion not only wastes valuable time for individuals but also has economic repercussions, affecting productivity and increasing fuel consumption. By promoting alternative transportation methods and adopting smart urban planning strategies, we can create more efficient and livable cities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a myriad of advantages, ranging from environmental sustainability to public health and economic benefits. While the transition may pose initial challenges, the long-term gains for our planet and society make it a worthwhile endeavor. As we continue to explore alternative modes of transportation and urban planning, we move closer to a future where the advantages of limiting car usage become increasingly apparent and indispensable.",1,"in recent year the idea of limit car usage have gain momentum as a means to address various societal and environmental challenge this essay will explore the advantage of reduce our reliance on car draw insight from various source by do so we can well understand the multifaceted benefit that such a shift can bring

256,1,"Dear Florida senator, I am writing to you today to address what everyone is talking about which is in fact the Electoral College. It has been that topic widely talked about so i decided to research what it actually means and why it causes controversy. People have viewed the Electoral College as an anachronism and they argue it should be overruled by popular vote but it is a very strong way to select electors and it wouldn't be in use at the moment if it wasn't the right way. According to Bradford Plumer, the single best argument against the Electoral College is what is known as the disaster factor. After reading ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, it provided me with information like how it was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution. The founding fathers are very respected individuals mainly because they were of very great intelligence, so that proves how they came up with something professional.

Though it may seem that the abundance of people are in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States, there are people like I who believe and wish for the best like how keeping the Electoral College is the way to go. In 2000, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote happened but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. I agree with Richard A. Posner that it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, I am not the only one who agrees because the facts also prove him right. With being a senator or anyone in office comes lot of pressure, Yet luckily with the Electoral College comes reduction of that pressure. It provides a clear winner when there are times of crisis like for example a runoff election.

The states with a larger capacity the large states receive more electoral votes , that is why people argue that it may seem unfair that some states get more participation in the election than others but it is actually very fair since there is more people in that state. I personally believe that the people who argue about the votes are those in the smaller states who feel they dont get the right to vote, it may look unfair but if all states got the same amount of electoral votes given than not everyone in the larger states would get a saying. Also, that is not mentioning the Swing States which are the ones who focus on the ""tossup"" states. With that pressure the tossup states are more likely to pay attention the campaign and are the most thoughtful voters and that just proves they deserve to get a majority of votes given.

Considering it may look like changing the election to popular vote may be the right option because it has many small reasons, it is better to have 5 strong reasons than a million unimportant ones to keep something very important. So I congratulate you and the people in office for keeping an open mind of what ""we the people"" have to say but also for knowing that what is in place now is right and should stay this way.",0,"dear Florida senator I be write to you today to address what everyone be talk about which be in fact the Electoral College it have be that topic widely talk about so I decide to research what it actually mean and why it cause controversy People have view the Electoral College as an anachronism and they argue it should be overrule by popular vote but it be a very strong way to select elector and it would n't be in use at the moment if it be n't the right way accord to Bradford Plumer the single good argument against the Electoral College be what be know as the disaster factor after read what be the Electoral College by the Office of the Federal Register it provide I with information like how it be establish by the found father in the Constitution the found father be very respected individual mainly because they be of very great intelligence so that prove how they come up with something professional

328,0,"Do you ever wonder why the world is becoming so much warmer by the minute? Not many people stop and realize what's the real problem. Us humans are the major problem in this situation, we don't see that we are taking what we have to an advantage. To our factories, cars, or even trash. The main one that is causing our greenhouse gases to rise is our Power plants, but following behind the power plants are vehicles. Cars have become a major impact in our lives, from hurting one another, to hurting the place we live on. Carfree cities are going to help make a big, helpful change in peoples lives.

In the city of Vauban, Germany 70 percent of the families do not own a car. Vauban is called a ""carfree"" place, cars aren't allowed on the streets of vauban. Many people sold their cars to live in vauban, all around vauban wants a healthy way of living. Vauban allows car ownership, but the cars are only to be parked in two places which are the garages. ""When I had a car i was always tense, I'm much happier this way,"" Heidrun Walter said. It is a much healthier and less stressful way of living, new ideas will always come in handy. The United States Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""Car Reduced"" communities. Hopefully they get someone to tag along with this promotion, and get supporters to enforce it.

Bogota, Colombia is going on their third straight year of a ""Car Free"" city. They are wanting to reduce smog, so buses and taxis are permitted. ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" Carlos Arturo claimed. There was a consequence to the ones who didn't follow the rules, which was a 25 fine that they had to pay each time. Eventually, Two other Cities in Colombia, Cali and Valledupar, latched on to the idea of a ""Car reduction."" You see many people walking, running, riding bikes or skateboarding. A lot of people like this new idea that people are going by, it's an great way to step foward to save the earth and its problems.

Over time, Americans haven't been buying cars, driving less, and over years less people get their license. America is hitting its driving peak, The number of miles driven peaked in 2005 and then decreased signifigantly since then. Not many can afford a brand new car, or the insurance, most people are unemployed and dont work at all. Cars have been around for a long time, but over that time period it has caused major life impacting issues. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift,"" said mimi sheller. Many people aren't aware of this ""Car Free"" idea, which is an disadvantage. If this idea was spread through televison, newspapers, or even social media many people will pick it up and take it into consideration.

In an overall sum up, it is better to live ""Car Free."" You wouldn't have to stress yourself out about gas prices, fixing your cars, or your world becoming a big ball of heat. If Transportation and power plants are the two major impacts in our lives, we need to knock one out. Until, we can get some second options on power plants our best choice is to forbid cars. We have many other options to get around our city, running, walking, riding bikes or etc. The ""Car Free"" idea is very creative, not many people would take inisuative to help make the world a better and safer place. With an exception of a few, buses and taxis will be there for long distance trips. Cars caused a huge impact on our lives, but hurting us and our home which we call earth. The business plan is ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey."" Think of all the advantages cars have given, but think about all of the disadvantages the cars have showed. Which one out weighs the other? Cars aren't always there to help us, life is all about choices, it's time to make yours.",0,"do you ever wonder why the world be become so much warm by the minute not many people stop and realize what be the real problem us human be the major problem in this situation we do n't see that we be take what we have to an advantage to our factory car or even trash the main one that be cause our greenhouse gas to rise be our Power plant but follow behind the power plant be vehicle car have become a major impact in our life from hurt one another to hurt the place we live on carfree city be go to help make a big helpful change in people life

751,0,"The Automobile Industry has done nothing but grow since World War II. The Car has begun to implement itself into our culture, becoming a part of sporting events, TV shows, and even video games. Recently, however, the automobile industry has been experiencing a shift in interest. Countries around the world are implementing ""Car Free Days,"" or even carfree cities into their laws and cultures. The new laws and ideas are seen by some as irrelevant, or pointless, and some have even resisted these laws. While car lovers and enthusiasts may not enjoy the laws very much, when implemented on their daily lives, studies have shown that the new ideas are extremely important, maybe even revolutionary.

The car free environment begins in the German suburbia, where residents of a large community called Vauban live their daily lives CarFree. Vauban is free of street parking and driveways, and full of cyclists, skateboarders, roller blades, and any other emmision free means of transportation you can imagine. Because of this, nearly 3 out of 4 families in Vauban do not own cars. ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, mother of 2 and resident of Vauban, Germany, mentioned in source 1. Car owners in Vauban park the vehicles in garages at the edge of town, to make commutes to nearby developments. Car free cities like Vauban are believed to be the next step to a greener, better world.

More efforts like Vauban are being made in large cities like Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia. According to source 2, Paris recently enforced a law to reduce emmisions, where even number plated cars may drive on Monday, and odd number plated cars my drive on Tuesday, and so on. The laws soon proved ineffective after a short time, for Paris to recind them. Paris, being one of the most polluted European cities, will certainly be making more efforts against pollution. An improvement campaign in Bogota, Columbia calls for one whole day without cars, according to source 3. Citizens are urged to take other means of transportation, like bikes or busses. Violators faced a 25 fine. The dark gray rainclouds didn't stop the citizens of Bogota from taking away stress and air pollution. This year, for the first time, two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined Bogota in the event. Cities around the world like Paris and Bogota are making efforts to reduce air pollution and leading better lives in cleaner cities.

Driving in America hit it's peak in 2005, when the number of miles driven in relationship to population was largest, according to source 4. Since then, the stats have dropped steadily, now sitting 9% below what it was in 1995. Many sociologists believe that the biggest decrease in milage is shown in young people between 16 and 39. Studies show that driving by these people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009. Many experts now believe that America's car culture has hit its peak, and is now on the decline.

There are many advantages of limiting car usage. The people of Bogota, Vauban, and Paris know that in most cases, cars cause stress, and that even a day without it can refresh your mind. The citizens of Vauban, who do not use cars in their daily lives, are living comfortably, and happily, without producing carbon emmisions into the environment. Even Americans are jumping on the band wagon, where young people are now using cars only when public transport is unavailable. Cars make moving easy, there is no doubt in that. But can the emmisions of the vehicles be avoided, without sacrificing the quality of our daily life? According to Vauban, Bogota, and Paris, it can be done, and it will be done.",0,"the Automobile Industry have do nothing but grow since World War II the car have begin to implement itself into our culture become a part of sporting event tv show and even video game recently however the automobile industry have be experience a shift in interest country around the world be implement Car Free day or even carfree city into their law and culture the new law and idea be see by some as irrelevant or pointless and some have even resist these law while car lover and enthusiast may not enjoy the law very much when implement on their daily life study have show that the new idea be extremely important maybe even revolutionary

574,1,"Dear state senator, I think that we should change to start voting by popular vote because it will be easier for the voters and is a more realistic way of voting.

When voting and following the rules of the electoral college, many voters get confused. As is says in source 2, many voters vote for the wrong person. They also don't always get control over who they vote for. Say they voted for one candidate to be their state senator, well with that one person comes many people that have ""pledged"" themselves to that candidate. They would be voting for the candidate and these many people that have pledged themselves to him and they don't even know it.

Also as they say in source 2, the election of 2000 was a huge mishap in presidential election history. In states like Louisiana, they had people replace democratic electors so that the popular vote that would've went to one of the candidates, didn't actually go through. Although the electoral college is good for getting exact numbers and helps solve disputes source 3it is an uruly and untrustworthy way of voting and should not be used anymore. Voters are easily confused when voting and many do not follow up on what is happening during election time. I think that a better way to vote would be to vote more often and give the electors another chance to be relected so that after a few months if voters changed their mind then they could reelect someone else.

Popular vote is a much better idea not only becuase it is more realistic, but because it is easier to understand. Even some of our presidents like Richard Nixon and Bob Dole have thought that this was the way to go. Not only do they believe this, but they lost their presidency votes becuase of the electoral college. I think that they are just trying to scam voters and pick someone that would be best for them, not for our country. I think that by using the electoral college method, they are cheating into picking the winners, but if we used popular vote, this wouldnt happen.

Thank you for your time.",0,"dear state senator I think that we should change to start vote by popular vote because it will be easy for the voter and be a more realistic way of voting

 popular vote be a much well idea not only becuase it be more realistic but because it be easy to understand even some of our president like Richard Nixon and Bob Dole have think that this be the way to go not only do they believe this but they lose their presidency vote becuase of the electoral college I think that they be just try to scam voter and pick someone that would be good for they not for our country I think that by use the electoral college method they be cheat into pick the winner but if we use popular vote this would nt happen

My fellow citizens there is many advantages of limiting car usage. Not being tense, not worried about the responsibilities on your car, and helps us to stop polluting the air.

To start, there are many places that don't have cars and their life keeps on going they are even stressfree. For example vaughn's streets are completely ""car free."" Heidrum Walter says ""when I had a car I was always tese. I'm much happier this way."" Source 1. Living without a car is not that bad. Living without a car can be much better for us. However the fact that living without car can be an advantage to us not everyone agress to the fact of it. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global cirty. congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog. Paris typically has more smog than oter European capital. Delivery companies complained of lost reveue, while exceptios were made for plug in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Source 2. If the delivery companies and my fellow citizens can realize is that the cars that we so called center our development on is polluting our air causing smog in certain areas of the world, and you can see because Paris banned certain cars in its area the smog ended up going away. So instead of driving our cars everywhere we can use this to our advantages and limit our car usage, so we can prevet smog in our community and pollution in atmosphere.

In addition, good car less is a stress free zone. Business Carlos Arturo Plaza stated ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Which is absolutely true in my view because in Bogota, colombia a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombias hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. Source 3. The car free day in Bogota and how people walked, biked, skated, and etc shows a great way to to take away stress. While you are either walking, biking, and so forth you have the chance to clear your mind and at the same time your not in a car that can pollute the air which can't result in smog. Also going car free is also becoming the new tread, a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, there has also been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39 year olds getting a license. source 4 I'm here today to show that this new tread that is spreading is one that we should take to our advantage and use it, it's making things better for us and also our communities.

To sum up, my fellow citizens we should limit our car usage. We all can enter this stree free zone together as one, we can help the place we all call our home.

1659,0,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:

Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many parts of the world, including Europe, the United States, and Colombia. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting alternative modes of transportation. By examining examples from Germany, France, and Colombia, as well as recent studies on shifting American behavior, it becomes evident that limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment.

Body Paragraph 1: Reduced Environmental Impact

Limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are mainly caused by passenger cars. According to the article, automobiles account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas of the United States. By promoting car-free communities and compact suburbs, the reliance on cars can be reduced, leading to a decrease in emissions. For example, Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, has seen a decrease in car ownership, with 70 percent of families not owning cars. This reduction in car usage directly contributes to a decrease in emissions.

Body Paragraph 2: Improved Quality of Life

Aside from the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can greatly enhance individuals' quality of life. The article highlights how residents of the car-free community in Vauban, Germany, have reported higher levels of happiness and reduced stress levels since giving up their cars. Walking and cycling become a more prevalent means of transportation, creating a healthier and more active lifestyle. By relying less on cars, people can enjoy cleaner and quieter streets, free from the noise and pollution associated with heavy traffic.

Body Paragraph 3: Enhanced Urban Planning

Limiting car usage also encourages urban planning that is conducive to walking, cycling, and public transportation. Instead of building sprawling suburbs with extensive parking spaces, new developments are being designed to prioritize accessibility and proximity to public transportation and amenities. This approach can create more vibrant, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods where stores, parks, and cultural institutions are within walking distance. By reducing the need for cars, space previously allocated for parking lots can be repurposed for green spaces, bike lanes, and community gathering areas.

Conclusion:

The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and extend beyond individual benefits to encompass environmental, societal, and urban planning advantages. By adopting a more sustainable approach to transportation, cities and suburbs can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve overall quality of life, and create more walkable and vibrant communities. The success of car-free communities in Germany, the implementation of driving restrictions in Paris, and the popularity of car-free days in Bogota demonstrate the feasibility and positive outcomes of limiting car usage. As attitudes towards car ownership shift and alternative modes of transportation gain popularity, it is imperative that societies embrace these changes and continue to prioritize sustainable and smart planning principles.",1,"title the advantage of limit car usage

2096,1,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to advocate for an important representation issue: the Electoral College. As a constituent who deeply cares about the way our democracy operates, I believe it is critical to rethink this mechanism. I argue for a shift to a national popular vote system for presidential elections. 

The Electoral College, established as a compromise during the founding of our country, selects the President and Vice President (Office of the Federal Register). However, it does not necessarily align with the democratic principles of representation. Bradford Plumer and Judge Richard A. Posner discuss the potential flaws and merits of this system.

Plumer argues that the Electoral College is outdated, irrational, and has potential for disaster (Plumer 14). There could be confusion among voters about who they are actually voting for, and ""faithless"" electors could potentially betray the people's will (Plumer 10,11). In close elections, the vote could be thrown to the House of Representatives, where smaller states have disproportionate say, a result that would undemocratically represent the will of the people (Plumer 12). Furthermore, the focus on swing states leads to many states being ignored during campaigns (Plumer 13).

While Posner acknowledges these complexities, he provides five reasons to retain the Electoral College, such as the certainty of outcome, requiring trans-regional appeal for candidates, focusing efforts on swing states, and avoiding run-off elections (Posner 17-22). However, these reasons are largely practical considerations rather than principled bases.

While the Electoral College does produce a clear winner (Posner 22), it does not always reflect the popular vote, as shown by the elections of 2000 and 2016. Furthermore, the focus on swing states leaves many Americans feeling ignored during campaigns, undermining the argument that the Electoral College system supports voter attentiveness (Posner 20). 

A shift to a national popular vote would ensure that every vote casts equals impact, reducing the potential for disproportionate representation. There would be no need to worry about ""faithless"" electors defying the will of the people (Plumer 11). Furthermore, candidates would need to focus on appealing to voters across the nation, not just those in swing states, leading to broader inclusivity in campaigns.

However, it is important to consider possible complications of direct democracy, such as the potential for minority rights to be overridden by majority rule. 

The complexity of this issue calls for thorough research and evaluation. Therefore, I encourage your attention to this matter to ensure that our democracy accurately represents the will of the American people. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

1398,0,"In contemporary society, the call to limit car usage has become increasingly urgent, driven by concerns ranging from environmental sustainability to public health and urban planning. The advantages of reducing our reliance on automobiles are numerous and impact various facets of our lives.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Research from the International Energy Agency underscores the significant contribution of cars to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By decreasing the number of vehicles on the road, we can actively combat environmental degradation, working towards a more sustainable and eco-friendly future.

Additionally, a reduction in car usage correlates with improved public health. Studies published in the American Journal of Public Health indicate that a decrease in car dependency is associated with increased physical activity. Encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling, not only reduces the prevalence of sedentary lifestyles but also contributes to a healthier populace, subsequently alleviating the strain on healthcare systems.

Economically, limiting car usage presents tangible benefits. The World Economic Forum has highlighted the economic toll of traffic congestion, which leads to lost productivity and increased fuel consumption. By promoting alternative transportation methods and investing in efficient urban planning, we have the potential to reduce congestion, save time, and lower economic costs associated with fuel consumption and productivity losses due to traffic delays.

Furthermore, the advantages extend to urban planning and community development. The Urban Land Institute's research suggests that smart urban planning strategies emphasizing public transportation and walkable spaces can result in more livable cities. Beyond easing the strain on existing infrastructure, such planning fosters a sense of community and well-being.

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a comprehensive solution to contemporary challenges, encompassing environmental sustainability, public health, economic efficiency, and improved urban living. By drawing evidence from multiple sources, it is clear that a reduction in car dependency is not only desirable but also essential for building a balanced and sustainable future.",1,"in contemporary society the call to limit car usage have become increasingly urgent drive by concern range from environmental sustainability to public health and urban planning the advantage of reduce our reliance on automobile be numerous and impact various facet of our life

219,0,"A major form of transportation that has been around for a long time is driving in cars.

Now, people are relying less on cars and are finding different methods of commuting. Some countries are even banning cars. Limiting car usage will have many advantages, such as reducing stress and benefitting the environment.

Cars come with a large amount of responsibility, which causes people to have stress.

Many people are actually happier without cars. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two, stated that ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal People can be tense from having a car because they have to do things like pay for insurance, pay the monthly bill for the actual car, pay for gas, and worry about where to park. Living a life without a car means that you are saving money and you are walking and biking more. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city."" Source 3: Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky Due to the lowering in the number of cars, people are being able to go outside more into new parks, go workout with friends, or just enjoy the outdoors. All of this is healthy and good for a person, and causes a person to relax and feel less stressed. Due to no cars on the road in Carfree day, there is no such thing as rush hour traffic, so people do not have to worry about leaving early or standing in traffic for a long period of time. Many who drive cars tend to have road rage, causing them to shout or get mad, which is not good for their health. People that drive to work on their bikes or use public transportation will not experience road rage, which will cause them to be happier. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife. Source 3: ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky Carfree day allowed this man to go to work in a fun way with his wife, enjoying the outdoors while also spending time together. If he had taken a car to work, he might have not went with his wife and had a good time. Limiting car usage will lead to less stress and happier people in the long run.

A big reason for the great amount of pollution in the world today is from cars.

Reducing the number of cars will also lead to a better environment with cleaner air. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal Pollution is a major problem in many counties, such as the United States, and limiting the amount of cars on the road will surely have a positive impact on the environment. It will not do any harm. ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behing power plants."" Source 4: The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal Since transportation is one of the major reasons for the amount of pollution in America, imagine the benefit to the environment that will occur if the amount of driving and car usage becomes limited. This is a very ambitious goal to curb America's greenhouse gas emissions. It is proven that fuel in cars is blamed for polluting counties. For example, Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, and is also blamed for polluting the country. Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer Smog is caused by the pollution, and is the key factor to the reason why Paris is banning driving. The only place the ban of cars will negatively effect is the car industry. People use their car sometimes for uneccessary situtations, such as driving to a friends house if they live a short distance away. ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Source 4: The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal It is not always needed to drive somewhere to meet up with someone. Technology nowadays, such as cellphones and computers, allow us to call, text, or video chat with people who are far away. This saves time and gas, and will be better for the environment.

Cars are not always necessary for commuting, and they also cause stress. They are harming our environment by polliuting it with its carbon emissions. There are other ways of transportation, such as public transportation, walking, or riding your bike. Limiting the amount of car usage will lead to people being healthier and less stressed, as well as the air being cleaner.",0,"a major form of transportation that have be around for a long time be drive in car

18,0,"We live in a world where the only way to get from place to place is to use a car. If we were to limit the amount of car usage all around the world we would be living in a much better place. Imagine how much pollution is going into the air as we use our cars, many people all around the world use their cars to get from their home to work or from work to home. All the pollution that is going into the air is affecting us and the way we live our everyday lives.

In the city of Bogota Columbia they have a ""Car Free Day."" This program is set to spread to other countries in the next few years. During the event of car free day millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work or to their home. This caused the streets of the capital city to devoid all the traffic jams that they normally would have with the cars on the road. You would think the turnout would be extremely small for this event but no it was definitely not a small turnout. The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that occasionally dumped rain showers on Bogota. ""The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Imagine if the United states were to have a ""Car free day"" not many people would actually come and be apart of the event due to the fact that having cars is one of the most important things to have living in the United States.

In other countries or cities the people are worried about the air pollution that is going into our atmosphere. In the city of Paris, officials feel the same way about the citizens of there city using there car way to much and polluting the atmosphere. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Not many people agreed with this ban when it started. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to reuters. Twenty Seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Except there are some advantages to this ban, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france. But the smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most populated cities in the world. Having rules or banning certain things like a partial driving ban could have a good turnout or a really bad turnout with the citizens of that particular country or city.

However, some people may say that limiting car usage or banning certain things like driving won't help at all. They may state that banning something will make people rebel against it especially if it's with their car, and if that is how they get from place to place. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm curtural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason the resume the habit. Poeple in the Untied States have begun to decrease the use of cars in every state which means that everyday our atmosphere becomes less polluted.

Living in a world where cars are everyone's number one priority is horrible. Using a car is one of the main reasons why our earth is extremely polluted. Limiting the amount of car use has it's negative side and it also has it's positive sides. Could you imagine what it would be like to have a nonpolluted earth or living a better life by using bikes, skates or even just walking to places would be like. Limiting car usage would be the best thing anyone could ever do to make the earth a better place.",0,"we live in a world where the only way to get from place to place be to use a car if we be to limit the amount of car usage all around the world we would be live in a much well place imagine how much pollution be go into the air as we use our car many people all around the world use their car to get from their home to work or from work to home all the pollution that be go into the air be affect we and the way we live our everyday life

 however some people may say that limit car usage or ban certain thing like driving wo n't help at all they may state that ban something will make people rebel against it especially if it be with their car and if that be how they get from place to place recent study suggest that Americans be buy few car drive less and get few license as each year go by ""different thing be converge which suggest that we be witness a longterm curtural shift say Mimi Sheller a sociology professor at Drexel University with all these change people who stop car commute as a result of the recession may find less reason the resume the habit Poeple in the untied States have begin to decrease the use of car in every state which mean that everyday our atmosphere become less polluted 

 live in a world where car be everyone 's number one priority be horrible use a car be one of the main reason why our earth be extremely polluted limit the amount of car use have it be negative side and it also have it be positive side could you imagine what it would be like to have a nonpolluted earth or live a well life by use bike skate or even just walk to place would be like limit car usage would be the good thing anyone could ever do to make the earth a well place"
718,0,"There are so many ways that limiting car usage is good for me, you and just everyone in general! Yes cars do have their advantages but like everything else they also have a few disadvantages. People should limit car usage more all around the world and heres a few reasons why..

Auto mobiles help in many ways they help you get to where your going faster and in a comfortable sitting condition, but although your body is comfortable are you really relaxed? i presume not! Having a car is a big responsibility which can also be very stressful. Think about it when you didnt have a car as a kid and young adult you didnt have to worry about if the insurance on your bike is payed , or if there was any mechanical problems with your legs. cars are expensive to buy and they continue to be quite the hefty financial load after youve bought the car too especially if no well maintained. In the article ""IN GERMAN SUBURB, LIFE GOES ON WITHOUT CARS""' paragraph 3 sentences 46 Heidrun Walter says "" When i had a car i was always tense..."" This quote proves the point that having a car is quite stressful , but thats not all she goes on to say ""i'm much happier this way"" Why is she so much happier? cause not having or needing a car lifted a huge load off her shoulders thats one less thing to worry about on a daily basis.

Also lets not forget one of the biggest issues in the world POLUTION! Pollution is a huge problem that we constantly see on the news , hear on the radio , and we see every day. One of the worst forms of pollution is the kind thats in the air we breathe to live and cars play a role now lot of people may say ""my one car cant possibly cause that much pollution"" but if millions.. billions of people think the same way then thats billions of air polluting cars driving around the world polluting the air we breath to live! Paris made a great arrangement as stated in the article ""PARIS BANS DRIVING DUE TO SMOG"" they talk about how paris banned certain cars driving from one day and other cars the next. All the cars with even numbered liscense plates were to not be driven on monday and vice versa for the odd numbered liscense plates the next day. this was good because it only allowed about half the amount of cars that usually drive on a daily basis to drive. In time this should make quite the noticable difference in the smog and the overall experience of breathing the "" fresh air"".

In conclusion we should all limit car usage because it is less stress not having a car helps financially and lifts a great load of responsibility off of our shoulders and also if less people drive on a daily basis then there will be much less polution in the air and i dont know about you guys but id rather live longer than drive and die young, but thats just me.",0,"there be so many way that limit car usage be good for I you and just everyone in general yes car do have their advantage but like everything else they also have a few disadvantage People should limit car usage more all around the world and here a few reason why

640,0,"The number of positive connotations that limiting car usage around the world would have on society is infinite. It would lower congestion, promote more healthy and efficient means of travel, and it would reduce emissions by a very large factor. People around the world are turning towards methods of transportation that do not monopolize on the automobile. Maybe one day cars will be pass?

According to a study in Paris, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after prohibiting driving for a few days, and fining those who disregarded the experiment. Less congestion led to less road noise, which, in turn, made people ""happier."" It created a safer environment for children and parents alike. Having fewer cars on the road encouraged people to go outside whenever they could. Citizens of Vauban, a city in Germany, are taking this newfound peacefulness to an extreme. Driving is forbidden in their city and there are not any available parking spaces in the event that they still own a car! Vauban is an example of a city that was built based on ""smart planning."" More communities are adopting this ideal and try to have everything located within walking distance of a person's home. This encourages people to get to where they need to go without the use of an automobile. People nowadays also have the technology to communicate with others electronically, so that reduces the need for an automobile to get from point A to point B. Why waste the time and money on gas to communicate with someone when you could send them an email or text for a low cost in a matter of seconds?

This being said, limiting car usage promotes public transportation services. In Bogota, 118 miles worth of bicycle paths have been built in an effort to steer people away from automobiles. This encourages people to get from place to place via a healthy and fun means of transport. Undoubtedly, people are more likely to stay close to home without the accessibility of cars, so limiting the use of cars saves the time that would be spent on the roads.

Limiting car usage has major benefits when it comes to carbon emissions and environmental problems. President Obama has wanted to curb the United States' emissions and so far his goal is a success. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Smog has been severely reduced in countries around the globe since plans to limit car usage have gone into effect.

Limiting car usage might seem like something that ""would be good in theory,"" and it will definitely be a hard thing for today's generation to wrap their head around, but the positive impacts it would have on society are limitless. Congestion and emissions would be reduced, time spent commuting would be saved, and the world would be a much safer place to live in overall. Limiting car usage everywhere is definitely something to think about.",0,"the number of positive connotation that limit car usage around the world would have on society be infinite it would lower congestion promote more healthy and efficient mean of travel and it would reduce emission by a very large factor People around the world be turn towards method of transportation that do not monopolize on the automobile maybe one day car will be pass

401,0,"When you think about limiting car usage you might think ""Well how am I supposed to get there. Theres no way i'm able to get to my destination without a car."" Yes, I'm pretty sure we all would'nt want to walk five thousand miles to visit a friend three hours away, but here me out. Doesnt a car make you all tired? Knowing you have to pay a bill every month, or getting gas four times a week. Just imagine a world where thats not a problem.

In Vauban Germany they are most of the time a car free zone. Owners of cars aren't allowed to have cars in there garage or in the streets or wherever a car would normally be. They have to keep there cars in a space they buy at the edge of the community for 40,000 plus the paying for their homes. Now I wouldnt want to pay all this money to park my car. Most people in suburban homes sold their vehicles so that they could live there without a problem. Heidren Walter said,"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" She says as she's walking down the street she can actual listen to the community of children playing and not be drown out from the loud motor in the car.

Now, limiting car usage doesnt mean we all have to walk to our destinations. We could start using bicycles more often and actually get a benefit of working out. Sure it might make you all sweaty and gross. But make a plan to get up a little earlier and then wash up at wherever it is you are to be. And limiting cars doesnt mean every single one of us need to give up our cars. Instead we can find a friend who lives near to us or a fellow coworker and car pool. Instead of all two hundred employes lugging their cars on the road and getting stuck in torturous traffic. make a plan to get five people in a car and instead of two hundred cars on their way to work, there would only be about fourty cars going to the same place. That would clear up our roads and reduce traffic. In France Congestion was down sixty percent after reducing cars.

""Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Westurn Europe.."" ,according to Robert Duffer. People today are now worrying to much on their cars and how much it will cost them. Not worrying about jobs and insurance. The invention of the car was not to see who can get the most miles or whos car gets better horse power. It was about helping people get from A to B, and we can do just that.

There are many people out here who will think that limiting car use is a waste of time and like to keep things the same. But we can be the generation who changes that. If we could go down to one car a family and start car pooling with one another, or even start using bikes to go to places with our friends, we can help make the community a better place. One day just try. Try walking to the super market. Instead of making your mom drive you and your friends to the mall, try making a plan to all ride your bikes there. It doesnt hurt to try, so try to start.",0,"when you think about limit car usage you might think well how be I suppose to get there there s no way I be able to get to my destination without a car yes I be pretty sure we all would'nt want to walk five thousand mile to visit a friend three hour away but here I out do nt a car make you all tired know you have to pay a bill every month or get gas four time a week just imagine a world where that s not a problem

946,1,"Dear Senator, I am writing to you to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There are many reasons for keeping the Electoral College but the reasons I am going to point out ot you are, certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. There are also some reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College. For example voters vote for a slate of electors not the president.

First of all two reasons for keeping the Electoral College would be a certainty of outcome. Even though a dispute over an Electoral College vote is possible it is more likely to occur over a popular vote. A reason for this is the winning candidate's share of Electoral College exceeds his share of popular vote. For example, in a article called In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral vote compared to the 51.3 percent rodney received. Because of the winnertakeall basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory.

Another reason would be you avoid run off elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem no one candidate receiving a majority of votes. For example, in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, it states Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the poplar votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College.

Two more reasons for keeping the Electoral College are swing states and big states. The winnertakeallmethod of awarding electoral votes induces the candidate to focus campaigning in tossup states. These voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaigning going on. They are also more likely to be more thoughtful voters. Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by the malapportion,ent of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

A reason for not keeping the electoral college is that voters vote for a slate of electors not the president. These electors can be anyone not holding public office. The problem with is that electors can vote for whom ever they want. Some go against the candidate they are supposed to vote for. So voters are chosing the president they want.

In conlcusion please take my reasons for keeping the Electoral College into consideration. Again those reasons are certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. Also the reason not to keep the Electoral College is voters don't vote for a president, but a slate of electors who do.",0,"dear Senator I be write to you to argue in favor of keep the Electoral College there be many reason for keep the Electoral College but the reason I be go to point out ot you be certainty of outcome you avoid run off swing state big state there be also some reason for getting rid of the Electoral College for example voter vote for a slate of elector not the president

Subject: In Support of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider the importance of its preservation in our democratic system. While some argue for a shift towards a popular vote method for electing the President of the United States, I believe that the Electoral College provides crucial benefits that would be lost in such a change.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes, even though he won only 51.3% of the popular vote. This discrepancy highlights the importance of the Electoral College in preventing disputes over close elections. With the winner-take-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state results in a landslide electoral-vote victory. This system guarantees a clear victor and helps maintain stability and confidence in our electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the representation of all regions of our country. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which incentivizes candidates to campaign in various states and engage with a diverse range of voters. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that the president will represent the interests and concerns of citizens from different regions. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected and helps create a more united and balanced outcome.

Thirdly, the focus on swing states in a winner-take-all system encourages candidates to listen to voters and address their concerns more effectively. Voters in these states become highly engaged and informed, as they play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the election. This leads to a more thoughtful electorate, ensuring that the most informed citizens have a say in choosing the president.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a balance of power between large and small states. While the Senate's mal-apportionment can disadvantage large states, the Electoral College gives them more attention during campaigns. A candidate's victory in a large state like Florida will result in a higher number of electoral votes compared to a victory in a less populous state like Wyoming. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on densely populated areas and consider the concerns of citizens across the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner. This avoids the complications and delays that would arise if no candidate were to receive a majority of the votes. The certainty offered by the Electoral College allows for a smooth and efficient election process.

While some argue that a popular vote method would be fairer or more democratic, it is important to consider the practical benefits that the Electoral College provides. It ensures certainty, promotes the representation of all regions, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial element of our democratic system. Its preservation is vital to maintain stability, representation, and balance in our elections. I urge you to strongly consider these points when making decisions regarding potential changes to our electoral process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the information provided and make an informed decision that best serves our nation and its citizens.

55,0,"Many people throughout the world, would agree that car usage plays a significant role in daily lives. Although some may argue it plays an important role or a not so important role, the limitation of car usage would be a very helpful thing for everyone, and the world we are surrounded by. There are many advantages to cities being able to control the amount of cars being used everyday. Advantages such as, less pollution in the environment by creating less smog, making the cities and roads a lot safer, by lowering the risk of getting into or even causing a wreck, or even something as simple as making your life, and the lives around you much more peaceful.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. paragraph 5"" Cars are the number one cause of pollution in most cities, especially ones that have large amounts of drivers on the road in a single day. The author of source one, states in paragraph 8 that ""..some new suburbs may well look more Vaubanlike not only in developed countries, but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities"" All authors state that limiting car usage, is a great way to reduce air pollution. Paragraph 10, of source two, states that ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" If car usage was limited in cities there would be less smog, and pollution in the air. Not only would it be better for the environment, it would also be better for your health.

Wrecks are things that claim the lives of people each and everyday. Some can be prevented, yet not all can. Think of how many lives are taken each day, due to wrecks because of things like congestion in big cities. Or even things such as someone behind the wheel who is stressed, and driving recklessly. A source from paragraph 3, states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Many people, get tense and stressed from the drivers around them. Limiting how much you use a car, can improve things such as stress levels. Imagine how much more at ease you would be if you constantly heard, a bicylest wizzing by you, or hearing children chattering and laughing among themselves, instead of hearing horns honking, loud motors, or even the sound of a car crash.

Roads and streets take up much more space than we think or even realize. With less cars on the road everyday and more people walking, or riding a bike, could only mean one thing less roads and bigger sidewalks. More cities are trying to make limiting car usage a much bigger thing, ""...in attempts to make suburbs more compact..."" Source one, also states that ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather that in malls along some distant highway. paragraph 6"" Getting to these places will become safer for everyone.

As you can see, there are many advantages to limiting car usage, such as, limiting the amount of pollution there is, lowering the risks of getting into, or even causing a wreck, and even something as simple as making it a more peaceful environment to live in, not only for yourself, but for others around you. Our world, and daily lives would be affected in great ways, in more cities, and even more countries, participated in lessing the amount of car usage.",0,"many people throughout the world would agree that car usage play a significant role in daily life although some may argue it play an important role or a not so important role the limitation of car usage would be a very helpful thing for everyone and the world we be surround by there be many advantage to city be able to control the amount of car be use everyday advantage such as less pollution in the environment by create less smog make the city and road a lot safe by lower the risk of get into or even cause a wreck or even something as simple as make your life and the life around you much more peaceful
